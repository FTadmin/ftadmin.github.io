    <!-- FAQ -->
    <section class="support-section">
        <h2>Frequently Asked Questions</h2>

        <h3>How often should I track my mood?</h3>
        <p>Mental health professionals typically recommend checking in 2-3 times per day - perhaps morning, afternoon, and evening. This gives you a balanced view of your emotional state throughout the day. You can set reminders in the app to help build this habit.</p>

        <h3>What is Apple Health State of Mind?</h3>
        <p>State of Mind is Apple's mental health tracking feature introduced in iOS 18. It lets you log your momentary emotions and daily mood. Mood Diary fully integrates with this feature, allowing your mood ratings to sync with Apple Health for comprehensive mental wellness tracking.</p>

        <h3>Can this app replace therapy?</h3>
        <p>No. Mood Diary is a tracking tool, not a treatment. It's designed to complement professional mental health care, not replace it. If you're struggling with your mental health, please consult a licensed therapist, counselor, or psychiatrist.</p>

        <h3>How does AI trigger detection work?</h3>
        <p>When you add notes to your mood entries, AI analyzes the text to identify recurring words and themes. For example, if you mention "coffee with Sarah" multiple times and your mood is consistently higher on those days, the app will show that as a positive influence. This happens entirely on your device for privacy.</p>

        <h3>Is my mood data private?</h3>
        <p>Absolutely. Your mood entries are encrypted and stored only on your device and in your private iCloud account. We never see, access, or share your mental health information. It's as private as your Apple Health data.</p>

        <h3>Can I export my mood history?</h3>
        <p>Yes. You can export your mood data as PDF, Excel, or JSON files. Many users share these reports with their therapist or doctor to provide context for treatment discussions.</p>

        <h3>Does it work offline?</h3>
        <p>Yes. You can log your mood anytime, even without an internet connection. Your entries will sync to iCloud when you're back online.</p>

        <h3>Can I track mood for specific conditions?</h3>
        <p>While the app provides general mood tracking, many users find it helpful for monitoring conditions like depression, anxiety, bipolar disorder, or seasonal affective disorder. Always discuss your tracking data with your healthcare provider.</p>

During that time I found this app, and it's been pretty amazing to see the erraticness of my un medicated brain compared to my medicated brain. My medicated brain is much more level in the graph. Plus I like that I can jot down what's on my mind really fast."</p>
