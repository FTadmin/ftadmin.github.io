    <!-- How It Works -->
    <section class="platforms-section">
        <h2 class="center-text">Track Sleep in Three Simple Steps</h2>
        <div class="app-card">
            <h3>1. Log Sleep Times</h3>
            <p>Each morning, enter when you went to bed and when you woke up. Optionally add notes about sleep quality, dreams, or factors that may have affected your rest.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="app-card">
            <h3>2. Review Patterns</h3>
            <p>View your sleep history in a calendar format. See your average sleep duration, identify nights with poor sleep, and track improvements over time.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="app-card">
            <h3>3. Get Insights</h3>
            <p>Let AI analyze your notes to show what helps or hurts your sleep. Discover correlations between your habits and sleep quality to make better decisions.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="app-card">
            <h3>4. Improve Your Sleep</h3>

    <!-- FAQ -->
    <section class="support-section">
        <h2>Frequently Asked Questions</h2>

        <h3>How much sleep do I need?</h3>
        <p>Most adults need 7-9 hours of sleep per night, though individual needs vary. The app helps you track your sleep duration and identify your personal optimal amount based on how you feel.</p>

        <h3>Does this app automatically track sleep?</h3>
        <p>No. Unlike Apple Watch or other wearables, Sleep Diary requires manual logging. You enter your sleep and wake times each morning. However, you can import sleep data from Apple Health if you use other automatic tracking devices.</p>

        <h3>Can I log naps?</h3>
        <p>Yes. You can log multiple sleep periods per day, including naps. Each entry shows duration, and the calendar displays all your sleep/wake times.</p>

        <h3>What's the difference between this and Apple Health?</h3>
        <p>Sleep Diary provides a dedicated interface for sleep tracking with features specifically designed for managing sleep patterns - notes, AI insights, trends, and easy manual logging. It integrates with Apple Health but offers more detailed sleep-focused features.</p>

        <h3>How does AI help with sleep insights?</h3>
        <p>When you add notes about your day (e.g., "had coffee at 8pm" or "exercised in the morning"), AI analyzes these over time to show correlations with your sleep duration and quality. This helps identify what promotes or disrupts good sleep.</p>

        <h3>Can I share sleep data with my doctor?</h3>
        <p>Yes. Export your sleep history as PDF or Excel reports to share with healthcare providers. This is particularly useful if you're being evaluated for sleep disorders or insomnia.</p>

        <h3>Does it track sleep quality or just duration?</h3>
        <p>The app primarily tracks sleep duration (hours slept) based on your logged sleep and wake times. You can add notes about sleep quality, dreams, or how rested you feel, which helps with qualitative tracking.</p>

        <h3>Is there a reminder to log sleep?</h3>
        <p>Yes. You can set daily reminders to log your sleep times. Many users set a morning reminder to prompt them to record the previous night's sleep.</p>

When I asked for an app, they suggested consensus Sleep Diary, which is useless. Luckily I found this app and I immediately asked my Sleep doctor to start recommending it. I also appreciate how responsive the developer is. Clearly this person wants to improve lives. THANK YOU!!"</p>

That was an error I made early on and can't seem to change without a Mac computer, according to Apple. Now getting down to reviewing this app. This app is awesome for monitoring your sleep habits, time and being able to make notes for future reference. It's simple and easy to use. I had a suggestion, something I was hoping to have changed, and the app developer Gaurav was absolutely amazing!! I reached out to him, and he got back to me within minutes and within days he actually added my suggestion! I highly recommend using this to keep a record of your sleep patterns. And it's absolutely worth subscribing to. Gaurav Sharma, you are a rockstar!!"</p>

This app has been great at keeping me accountable to a schedule and looking at my progress. I can track hours slept, dreams I have had, patterns of sleep as well as other data that I want to review. Only issue is sometimes App does not open right away on my IPAD and have to force close it and then re-open it. Update - have used app 400 nights now and it shows me progress I've made in my CPAP therapy and a lot of useful insights!"</p>
