    <h1>Frequently Asked Questions</h1>

    <h3>How do I add a record?</h3>
    <p>You can add a new record by either 1. pressing on the day or 2. pressing + in the top right. Both options are shown to by the arrows in the image below.</p>
    <img src="images/add_new.jpg" class="screenshot">

    <h3>Can I record multiple times a day?</h3>
    <p>Yes. You can add many records per day, as shown above. Just press on the day again, or on +, to do this.</p>

    <h3>How do I delete a record?</h3>
    <p>To delete a record, you can swipe left on the record and press Delete, or press on the record to open it and press the trash can icon in the top left of the screen. Both methods are shown below:</p>
    <p>
        <img src="images/delete_swipe.jpg" class="screenshot-small padded10">
        <img src="images/delete_trashcan.jpg" class="screenshot-small padded10">
    </p>

    <h3>Why do I see a sentiment score above my notes? Is this private?</h3>
    <p>When your notes contain 8 or more words, an emoji will appear above them to indicate the predicted sentiment. This feature can help you understand if your writing comes across as overly negative or positive, or remind you of what is or isn't working, serving as a guide for your writing. The sentiment is calculated entirely on your device using Apple's Natural Language API, so no data leaves your device, ensuring complete privacy. If you prefer, you can disable this feature in Settings under General.</p>

    <h3>How do I print?</h3
    <p>When you press export (as shown below), you'll see a share sheet. On this, scroll down and press Print (as shown below). You'll need an Apple AirPrint compatible wireless printer to print wirelessly from your iPhone or iPad.</p>
    <p>If you don't have an AirPrint compatible wireless printer, you can buy one <a href="https://geni.us/airprint_printer">here</a>.
    </p>
    <p> <img src="images/printing_example_ios.jpg" class="screenshot"></p>

    <h3>Can I share any medical information I'm tracking with my doctor?</h3>
    <p>Yes. The app makes this easy to do. Press the share button (as shown below), select PDF, and then choose your Mail app. The PDF report will be attached to an email you can then send to your doctor.</p>
    <p> <img src="images/sharing_example.jpg" class="screenshot"></p>

    <h3>How can I hide averages or totals in Journal?</h3>
    <p>You can hide averages and totals in view options, as shown below. That will then only show your entered values, and not averages. This can be useful if you find having the averages/totals in between your entered data confusing.</p>
    <p> <img src="images/hide_averages.jpg" class="screenshot"></p>


    <h3>Can I export to Excel or similar spreadsheet software?</h3>
    <p>Yes. Follow the instructions above, but select Excel or CSV instead of PDF as output format. Then either save the file on your device, or email it to yourself.</p>
    <p>Excel format is more reliable, while CSV may be more widely compatible - both should open in Excel and similar software, like Apple Numbers or Google Sheets.</p>

    <h3>Can I export my data before canceling my subscription?</h3>
    <p>Yes! In Journal and Stats, press the Export button (top right) and select all data to export. <strong>JSON format is best</strong> because it's universal (works with any software), human-readable (open it in any text editor), and preserves all your data completely.</p>
    <p>You can also make backups in Settings > Data > Manage Backups which include both your data and photos in a zip file that can be opened on any computer. Your data is always yours to keep, even if you cancel.</p>

    <h3>Who can I send my data to?</h3>
    <p>You can email it to anyone you like. You might want to periodically email your data to yourself for safekeeping and backup purposes. You can also save the PDF or CSV file on your device for later use.</p>

    <h3>How do I scroll straight to the current day in month view?</h3>
    <p>Double-tap the Journal icon in the tab bar at the bottom of your screen.</p>

    <h3>How do I view data from previous months?</h3>
    <p>To view data from a previous month (for example, September data when you're currently in October):</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Go to the Journal tab</li>
      <li>Press the back button in the top left corner - this will take you to month selection</li>
      <li>Select the month you want to view (e.g., September)</li>
      <li>If you don't see your data, press the Journal options button (the 2nd button along the top, next to the back button) and ensure all display options are set to "Show"</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Your data is always saved and accessible - you can navigate between months at any time to view your historical records.</p>
    <p><strong>If you still don't see your data after checking the month view:</strong> Go to Settings > Data > Manage Backups and look for any backups from the month you're trying to view (or early in the following month). If you find a backup from that time period, you can restore from it to recover your data. This can help if you've reinstalled the app or if there was a sync issue.</p>

    <h3>How do I change the time or date on a record?</h3>
    <p>Open a record and simply tap on the time or date to change it, as shown below.</p>
    <p> <img src="images/change_time_date.jpg" class="screenshot"></p>

    <h3>Do you show advertisements or track me across apps?</h3>
    <p><strong>No.</strong> We removed all advertisements and IDFA tracking from all Feeltracker apps. We don't track you across other apps or websites, and we never sell your data to advertisers. Your health data is private and belongs only to you. The apps are supported through optional premium subscriptions, not advertising revenue.</p>

    <h3>How safe is my data?</h3>
    <p>Your data is encrypted when stored on your device. This means even if your device is stolen, no one can access it.</p>

    <h3>Where is my data stored? Is it safe?</h3>
    <p>Your data is stored locally on your device (like Notes or Photos). If you have iCloud enabled, it syncs across your Apple devices. We never upload your data to our servers - it stays completely private and under your control.</p>

    <h3>Can anyone else see my private data?</h3>
    <p>No. The data only ever lives on your device and on iCloud, which runs on servers managed by Apple.</p>

    <h3>Are you registered with the ICO and compliant with GDPR?</h3>
    <p>Yes. Custom Arts Ltd is registered with the UK Information Commissioner's Office (ICO) under registration number ZB644620. We comply with both the UK General Data Protection Regulation (UK GDPR) and the EU General Data Protection Regulation (EU GDPR). You can verify our registration at <a href="https://ico.org.uk/ESDWebPages/Entry/ZB644620" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">ico.org.uk</a>.</p>

    <h3>What are my rights under GDPR?</h3>
    <p>Under UK and EU GDPR, you have several rights including: the right to access your data, the right to rectification (correction), the right to erasure (deletion), the right to data portability, and the right to object to processing. Since Feeltracker stores all your data locally on your device and in your personal iCloud account, you already have direct control over your data. You can view, export (in PDF, CSV, Excel, or JSON format), or delete your data at any time through the app's settings.</p>

    <h3>How do I request my data or exercise my GDPR rights?</h3>
    <p>Since your data is stored locally on your device and in your personal iCloud account, you can access, export, or delete it directly through the app without needing to contact us. Go to Settings > Data to manage backups, or use the Export feature in Journal/Stats to export your data in various formats. If you have any questions about your data rights, contact us at <a href="mailto:support@feeltracker.com">support@feeltracker.com</a>.</p>

    <h3>Why does my data need to be saved on iCloud?</h3>
    <p>iCloud enables your data to be backed up, and synced between your devices. Then if you lose your phone or get a new one, your data can be restored from iCloud.</p>

    <h3>Why isn't my data syncing across my devices?</h3>
    <p>Your data should automatically be synced across your devices. Ensure that:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>You're logged into the same iCloud account on all devices. </li>
      <li>All iOS devices are on the same version of iOS (preferably the latest).</li>
      <li>Ensure iCloud drive is On on all devices (in Settings > Your Name > iCloud > iCloud Drive, as shown below.</li>
      <p><img src="images/icloud_on.png" class="screenshot"></p>
    </ul>

    <h3>Do I have to have a subscription for each device?</h3>
    <p>One subscription will remove ads on all devices. If you see ads on any additional devices, go to Settings > Remove Ads, and press Restore Purchase. Ensure each device is logged into the same iCloud account.</p>

    <h3>How do Backups work?</h3>
    <p>Backups are made automatically every week by default (although you can turn this off in Settings). You can also create manual backups in Settings > Data.</p>

    <h3>How many backups are made? Should I delete them?</h3>
    <p>There’s no limit to number of backups made. Backups can go back years, and generally take very little space, so deleting them won't make much difference to your device's storage. If you need to free up space, it's better to delete heavier files on your device such as photos and videos.</p>

    <h3>Are backups synced to iCloud?</h3>
    <p>Currently backups aren’t synced on iCloud, but your current data is. That means if you get a new iPhone or iPad, your current data will appear there too, but not your backups, as each device keeps its own local backups.</p><p>This means that, for example if you delete a record on your iPhone and it’s gone from iCloud and your phone, you could still go back to your iPad and restore from one of its older backup snapshots.</p>

    <h3>Does the app have accounts or login?</h3>
    <p>No! The app works like Apple's Notes or Photos - no accounts, no login, no sign-up required. Your data is stored locally on your device and syncs via iCloud if you have it enabled. This means your data is completely private and under your control.</p>

    <h3>Can I use this app on both my iPhone and iPad?</h3>
    <p>Yes, and your data is automatically synced between them if logged into the same iCloud account. On the iPad version you have more space for notes, and can see more items.</p>

    <h3>Is there a Mac version of the app?</h3>
    <p>Yes. The apps is available for Apple Silicon Macs (M1 onwards). In the Mac app, you can resize the window to see more data on larger screens. You can download the Mac app <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/developer/custom-arts/id968118447">here</a> on your M1 or later Mac.</p>

    <h3>I would like to suggest a feature or improvement for the app.</h3>
    <p>We'd love to hear your feedback. Email us at <a href="mailto:feedback@feeltracker.com">feedback@feeltracker.com</a>.</p>

    <h3>Can I turn off the sound?</h3>
    <p>Yes. Go to the Settings tab and turn off the slider next to Enable Sound Effects.</p>

    <h3>What's the Trends tab for?</h3>
    <p>Trends lets you identify what's on your mind, why, and the effect it's having on you. Scroll down for more detail and some examples on how Trends works in your app.</p>

    <h3>Why do I not see anything in Trends?</h3>
    <p>For Trends to work, you need to take notes when you save records. You can do this on any record in the Notes field.</p>

    <h3>What's the Stats tab for?</h3>
    <p>This currently shows you all records between 2 dates, and an average/total in between that range. This enables you to get an average/total for any period.</p>

    <h3>What’s the difference between Journal, Trends and Stats?</h3>
    <p>Journal is the main diary/log section which lets you input data and view it on a monthly/yearly/lifetime basis, with averages and totals</p>
    <p>Trends lets you identify patterns in the data you're recording in Journal so you can act on them.</p>
    <p>Stats lets you see your data in chronological order (newest item first) without monthly or yearly grouping, and let's you see averages and totals between any two dates.<p>

    <h3>Should I log out or shut down, to save phone memory and battery?</h3>
    <p> There's no need at all to log out – the device automatically unloads apps/resources from memory as needed.</p>
    <p>Modern iPhones and iPads have a lot of energy-efficient memory, so apps can stay in memory for a long time without any adverse effects. Access to this memory is secure, and is already proteced by Face ID, Touch ID, or a passcode.</p>

    <p>If you'd like to close an app anyway (for example if it has become unresponsive) you can follow Apple's instructions <a href="https://support.apple.com/en-gb/HT201330">here</a>.</p>
    <p>There's no need to login either, as the app uses your iCloud account so already can sync/backup data across your devices, similar to how the Photos and Notes app do, without requiring any identifying personal data to be shared.</p>

    <h3>If I don't log out, is that safe?</h3>
    <p>Yes. As soon as you press the side button on the device, to lock it as you normally do, no one can get into your app or data while it's locked.</p>

    <h3>What's with the ads?</h3>
    <p>We want you to first try the app and see if you find useful, without any distractions - you can do this for free, without seeing Google ads. After you save 7 records, you may see some Google ads, which help support the app and keep it free.</p>

    <h3>I don’t like ads! Can I pay to remove them?</h3>
    <p>Yes! To do this, press the ❎ button on the banner. This will bring up the option to subscribe, for a nominal fee. While you are subscribed you will not see any ads.</p>

    <h3>I'm unable to pay, but hate ads in apps!</h3>
    <p>We hear you. These customised native ads are designed to blend in with the rest of the app and still look good, without being jarring or spammy. We want you to be able to enjoy using the app, even if you're unable to pay. Don't forget to tell your friends about it!</p>

    <h3>What does "free app with Premium upgrade" mean?</h3>
    <p>The app is completely free with all core features (tracking, charts, exports). Premium is an optional paid upgrade that adds advanced features like unlimited AI analysis, extended reports, and cloud backups. You can use the app fully without ever paying.</p>

    <h3>Why should I subscribe? Why can't I pay just once?</h3>
    <p>A small regular subscription fee makes the app easier to try without large upfront cost. Long-term, subscription revenue helps us maintain the app and funds the development of useful new features.</p>

    <h3>Will I lose my data when I update the app or upgrade to Premium?</h3>
    <p>No! All your data stays exactly where it is - nothing is lost. Whether you're updating to a new version of the app or upgrading to Premium, your readings remain safe. Premium just unlocks extra AI features on top of what you already have.</p>

    <h3>I love this app. How can I help make it even better?</h3>
    <p>Thank you - we love you too! The best way to help is to leave a 5-star review on the App Store. Your reviews help other people discover the app and motivate us to keep improving it. Thank you for being a valued customer!</p>

    <h2>Blood Pressure App</h2>

    <h3>Does camera scanning work with my blood pressure monitor?</h3>
    <p>Yes! The AI camera scanning works with ANY blood pressure monitor that has a digital display showing numbers. You don't need special "support" for your device - just point your camera at the screen and scan. This feature is free and unlimited for all users.</p>

    <h3>Does the app connect to my blood pressure monitor via Bluetooth?</h3>
    <p>No, the app does not connect directly to blood pressure monitors via Bluetooth. Instead, we've focused on making manual entry effortless through AI camera scanning technology. Simply point your iPhone's camera at your monitor's display after taking a reading, and the app automatically reads the numbers. This works with virtually any blood pressure monitor that has a digital display, regardless of brand or model. There's no pairing required, no specific device compatibility to worry about, and it takes just seconds. This feature is always free and unlimited.</p>

    <h3>How does AI Camera Scanning work?</h3>
    <p>After taking your blood pressure reading, open the app and tap the "+" button, then select "Scan with Camera." Hold your phone steady about 6-12 inches away from your monitor's display, making sure the numbers are clearly visible and well-lit. The app will automatically read the systolic, diastolic, and pulse values. For best results, ensure good lighting and keep your phone steady while scanning. This works with most digital monitors including OMRON, Microlife, and Beurer brands.</p>

    <h3>Why am I seeing duplicate entries?</h3>
    <p>This is usually caused by Apple Health sync configuration. The most common issue is having only write permissions enabled for Apple Health, but not read permissions. To fix this: Go to Settings > Data > Apple Health, and make sure BOTH read AND write permissions are enabled for Blood Pressure and Heart Rate - not just write. The app needs read permission to check if a reading already exists before importing from Health.</p>

    <h3>Can I track readings for multiple family members?</h3>
    <p>A tags feature is coming within the next few months that will let you track readings for multiple people on one device. You'll be able to tag each entry with a person's name and then generate individual reports for each family member.</p>

    <h3>My data isn't syncing between my iPhone and iPad. Why?</h3>
    <p>First, make sure you're signed into the same iCloud account on both devices. Go to Settings > [Your Name] and check the Apple ID. Second, verify that iCloud Drive is enabled on both devices (Settings > [Your Name] > iCloud > iCloud Drive). Your data syncs automatically through iCloud, but it requires an internet connection and can take a few minutes. Try opening the app on each device and pulling down to refresh.</p>

    <h3>What does the subscription include? What's free?</h3>
    <p>All core tracking features are completely free: unlimited entries, AI camera scanning (always free), all charts and trends, Apple Health sync, and PDF/CSV exports. The subscription adds: ad removal for a clean experience, enhanced AI chat (100 uses per day vs 10 free), and access to advanced AI features. All future premium features will be included for subscribers.</p>

    <h3>What is MAP and should I track it?</h3>
    <p>MAP (Mean Arterial Pressure) represents the average pressure in your arteries during one cardiac cycle. It's calculated automatically for every reading.

    <h3>How do I use note templates to save time?</h3>
    <p>When entering a note (like "Morning reading - before medication"), tap the "Template" button at the bottom left of the notes field and save it as a template. Next time you enter a reading, tap "Template" again and select from your saved templates - the text is inserted instantly. This is great for recurring notes like "Morning - pre-medication" or "Evening - after dinner."</p>

    <h3>What's too high or low a blood pressure?</h3>
    <p>Your blood pressure should normally be between 90-140 for systolic value, and 60-90 for diastolic value. If it's outside this range, you should speak to a doctor.</p>

    <h3>What's the ideal blood pressure?</h3>
    <p>According to the NHS, ideal blood pressure is between 90/60 mmHg and 120/80 mmHg. However, that can vary depending on sex, age, and other variables. Therefore it is best to consult your local doctor for an accurate assessment of your blood pressure based on your own individual circumstances.</p>

    <h3>How do I measure my blood pressure?</h3>
    <p>Blood pressure is measured using a digital blood pressure monitor. <a href="https://geni.us/B9RB">Here</a> you can find blood pressure monitors that work great with the Camera Scan AI feature.

    <h3>Can you explain Trends with an example?</h3>
    <p>For example, you go running 10 times. 5 times, your blood pressure goes down by 10, and the other times it goes down by 5. Trends will show that on average, running helps reduce your blood pressure by about 7.5 points.</p>

    <h3>How do I measure body fat?</h3>
    <p>Body Fat is reported by specially designed weight scales that measure body composition, as well as the weight. <a href="https://geni.us/PQXEb">Here</a> is an example of such scale, from Omron. There will be other options available too from other brands - the thing to look for is “Body Composition” as well as weighing scales.</p><p>Note also that even if you only enter weight, you’ll still see a BMI value (to the left of weight, color coded), which will give a broad indication of whether you are of a healthy weight (where green is good, and red is overweight).</p>
