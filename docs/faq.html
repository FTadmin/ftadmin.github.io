    <h1>Frequently Asked Questions</h1>

    <h3>Can I record multiple times a day?</h3>
    <p>Yes. You can record as many times as you like per day. Just press on a day again to do this.</p>

    <h3>How do I scroll straight to the current day in month view?</h3>
    <p>Double-tap the Journal icon in the tab bar at the bottom of your screen.</p>

    <h3>How safe is my data?</h3>
    <p>Your data is encrypted when stored on your device. This means even if your device is stolen, no one can access it.</p>

    <h3>Where is my data stored?</h3>
    <p>On your device, and on iCloud. This app uses the same technology as Apple Notes and Photos to save and sync your data across devices, meaning it's very reliable and secure.</p>

    <h3>Can anyone else see my private data?</h3>
    <p>No. The data only ever lives on your device and on iCloud, which runs on servers managed by Apple.</p>

    <h3>Why does my data need to be saved on iCloud?</h3>
    <p>iCloud enables your data to be backed up, and synced between your devices. Then if you lose your phone or get a new one, your data can be restored from iCloud.</p>

    <h3>Can I use this app on both my iPhone and iPad?</h3>
    <p>Yes, and your data is automatically synced between them if logged into the same iCloud account. On the iPad version you have more space for notes, and can see more items.</p>

    <h3>Is there a Mac version of the app?</h3>
    <p>Yes. It is available for Apple Silicon Macs (M1 onwards). In the Mac app, you can resize the window to see more data on larger screens. Search for this app under iPhone and iPad apps in the App Store on your Mac.</p>

    <h3>I would like to suggest a feature or improvement for the app.</h3>
    <p>We'd love to hear your feedback. If you're seeing this in the app, email us at <a href="mailto:support@feeltracker.com">support@feeltracker.com</a>.</p>

    <h3>Can I turn off the sound?</h3>
    <p>Yes. Go to the Settings tab and turn off the slider next to Enable Sound Effects.</p>

    <h3>Can I export or send my data to others?</h3>
    <p>Yes. In Journal, press the button with the box and arrow in the top right (the Share button). You can email yourself, or someone else, your data in CSV (Excel) or PDF report formats.</p>

    <h3>Is there anything I can do to support this app?</h3>
    <p>We're reliant on good reviews to grow the app and keep building new features, so a review would be very much appreciated - you can do this by pressing 'Review this app' in Settings.</p>

    <h3>Why do I not see anything in Trends?</h3>
    <p>For Trends to work, you need to take notes when you save records. You can do this on any record in the Notes field.</p>

    <h3>What's the Stats tab for?</h3>
    <p>This currently shows you all records between 2 dates, and an average/total in between that range. This enables you to get an average/total for any period.</p>


    <h2>Blood Pressure App</h2>

    <h3>What's too high or low a blood pressure?</h3>
    <p>Your blood pressure should normally be between 90-140 for systolic value, and 60-90 for diastolic value. If it's outside this range, you should speak to a doctor.</p>

    <h3>What's the ideal blood pressure?</h3>
    <p>According to the NHS, ideal blood pressure is between 90/60 mmHg and 120/80 mmHg. However, that can vary depending on sex, age, and other variables. Therefore it is best to consult your local doctor for an accurate assessment of your blood pressure based on your own individual circumstances.</p>

    <h3>What's Trends for?</h3>
    <p>With Trends, this app takes your data and notes, and shows what things affect you and how. For example, you could see that you meditated 20 times last year, and that meditation lowers your blood pressure. Conversely, you could see that every time you meet Bob, you argue, and he raises your blood pressure. The more you use notes, the more useful Trends can be.</p>

    <h3>Can you explain Trends with an example?</h3>
    <p>For example, you go running 10 times. 5 times, your blood pressure goes down by 10, and the other times it goes down by 5. Trends will show that on average, running helps reduce your blood pressure by about 7.5 points.</p>  


    <h2>Feeltracker Mood Diary App</h2>

    <h3>What's Trends for?</h3>
    <p>With Trends, this app takes your data and notes, and shows what things affect you and how.

Conversely, you could see that every time you meet Bob, you argue, and he makes you unhappy. The more you use notes, the more useful Trends can be.</p>

    <h3>Can you explain Trends with an example?</h3>
    <p>For example, you meet Jane 10 times. 5 times she made you very happy (+2), and 5 times she made you fairly happy (+1). Trends will show that on average Jane makes you quite (+1.5) happy.</p>


    <h2>Daily Journal Notes App</h2>

    <h3>What's Trends for?</h3>
    <p>With Trends, this app takes your data and notes, and shows what words are most on your mind. For example, you could see that you used a word 20 times last year. Conversely, you could see that you used another word 50 times - a lot more often. The more you use notes, the more useful Trends can be.</p>

    <h3>Can you explain Trends with an example?</h3>
    <p>For example, you write about Jane 120 times in your notes, more than about your job, which you write about 50 times. Trends in this case shows that clearly the top thing on your mind was Jane.</p>

Conversely, you could see that every time you eat salad or go to the gym, you lose sleep better. The more you use notes, the more useful Trends can be.</p>

    <h3>Can you explain Trends with an example?</h3>
    <p>For example, you drink coffee 10 times. 5 of those times, you underslept 2 hours, and the other 5 times you underslept 1 hour. Trends will show that on average, drinking coffee causes you to undersleep by 1.5 hours.</p>

    <h3>Can you explain Trends with an example?</h3>
    <p>For example, you eat donuts 10 times. 5 times, your weight goes up by 0.1kg. The other 5 times your weight goes up by 0.3kg. Trends will show that on average, eating donuts makes your weight go up by 0.2kg.</p>
