    <h3>Can I share any medical information I'm tracking with my doctor?</h3>

    <p> <img src="../images/sharing_example.jpg" class="screenshot"></p>


    <h3>Can I export to Excel?</h3>
    <p>Yes. Follow the instructions above, but select CSV instead of PDF as output format. Then either save the file on your device, or email it to yourself. The CSV file can be opened in Excel or other spreadsheet software like Google Sheets.</p>

    <h3>Who can I send my data to?</h3>
    <p>You can email it to anyone you like. You might want to periodically email your data to yourself for safekeeping and backup purposes. You can also save the PDF or CSV file on your device for later use.</p>

    <h3>How do I scroll straight to the current day in month view?</h3>
    <p>Double-tap the Journal icon in the tab bar at the bottom of your screen.</p>

    <h3>How do I change the time or date on a record?</h3>
    <p>Open a record and simply tap on the time or date to change it, as shown below.</p>
    <p> <img src="../images/change_time_date.png" class="screenshot"></p>

    <h3>How safe is my data?</h3>
    <p>Your data is encrypted when stored on your device. This means even if your device is stolen, no one can access it.</p>

    <h3>Where is my data stored?</h3>
    <p>On your device, and on iCloud. This app uses the same technology as Apple Notes and Photos to save and sync your data across devices, meaning it's very reliable and secure.</p>

    <h3>Can anyone else see my private data?</h3>
    <p>No. The data only ever lives on your device and on iCloud, which runs on servers managed by Apple.</p>

    <h3>Why does my data need to be saved on iCloud?</h3>
    <p>iCloud enables your data to be backed up, and synced between your devices. Then if you lose your phone or get a new one, your data can be restored from iCloud.</p>

    <h3>Why isn't my data syncing across my devices?</h3>
    <p>Your data should automatically be synced across your devices. Ensure that:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>You're logged into the same iCloud account on all devices. </li>
      <li>All iOS devices are on the same version of iOS (preferably the latest).</li>
      <li>Ensure iCloud drive is On on all devices (in Settings > Your Name > iCloud > iCloud Drive, as shown below.</li>
      <p><img src="../images/icloud_on.png" class="screenshot"></p>
    </ul>

    <h3>How do Backups work?</h3>
    <p>Backups are made automatically every week by default (although you can turn this off in Settings). You can also create manual backups in Settings > Data.</p>

    <h3>How many backups are made? Should I delete them?</h3>
    <p>There’s no limit to number of backups made. Backups can go back years, and generally take very little space, so deleting them won't make much difference to your device's storage. If you need to free up space, it's better to delete heavier files on your device such as photos and videos.</p>

    <h3>Are backups synced to iCloud?</h3>
    <p>Currently backups aren’t synced on iCloud, but your current data is. That means if you get a new iPhone or iPad, your current data will appear there too, but not your backups, as each device keeps its own local backups.</p><p>This means that, for example if you delete a record on your iPhone and it’s gone from iCloud and your phone, you could still go back to your iPad and restore from one of its older backup snapshots.</p>

    <h3>Do I need an account to use this app?</h3>
    <p>No. You can use it straight away without needing to login in or sign up. The app uses your iCloud account to automatically sync your data to any other devices, using Apple's infrastructure. This means it's fast, reliable and secure.</p>

    <h3>Can I use this app on both my iPhone and iPad?</h3>
    <p>Yes, and your data is automatically synced between them if logged into the same iCloud account. On the iPad version you have more space for notes, and can see more items.</p>

    <h3>Is there a Mac version of the app?</h3>
    <p>Yes. It is available for Apple Silicon Macs (M1 onwards). In the Mac app, you can resize the window to see more data on larger screens. You can download the Mac app <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/developer/feeltracker-ltd/id687449002">here</a> on your M1 Mac.</p>

    <h3>I would like to suggest a feature or improvement for the app.</h3>
    <p>We'd love to hear your feedback. Email us at <a href="mailto:feedback@feeltracker.com">feedback@feeltracker.com</a>.</p>

    <h3>Can I turn off the sound?</h3>
    <p>Yes. Go to the Settings tab and turn off the slider next to Enable Sound Effects.</p>

    <h3>What's the Trends tab for?</h3>
    <p>Trends lets you identify what's on your mind, why, and the effect it's having on you. Scroll down for more detail and some examples on how Trends works in your app.</p>

    <h3>Why do I not see anything in Trends?</h3>
    <p>For Trends to work, you need to take notes when you save records. You can do this on any record in the Notes field.</p>

    <h3>What's the Stats tab for?</h3>
    <p>This currently shows you all records between 2 dates, and an average/total in between that range. This enables you to get an average/total for any period.</p>

    <h3>What’s the difference between Journal, Trends and Stats?</h3>
    <p>Journal is the main diary/log section which lets you input data and view it on a monthly/yearly/lifetime basis, with averages and totals</p>
    <p>Trends lets you identify patterns in the data you're recording in Journal so you can act on them.</p>
    <p>Stats lets you see your data in chronological order (newest item first) without monthly or yearly grouping, and let's you see averages and totals between any two dates.<p>

    <h3>Should I log out or shut down, to save phone memory and battery?</h3>
    <p> There's no need at all to log out – the device automatically unloads apps/resources from memory as needed.</p>
    <p>Modern iPhones and iPads have a lot of energy-efficient memory, so apps can stay in memory for a long time without any adverse effects. Access to this memory is secure, and is already proteced by Face ID, Touch ID, or a passcode.</p>

    <p>If you'd like to close an app anyway (for example if it has become unresponsive) you can follow Apple's instructions <a href="https://support.apple.com/en-gb/HT201330">here</a>.</p>
    <p>There's no need to login either, as the app uses your iCloud account so already can sync/backup data across your devices, similar to how the Photos and Notes app do, without requiring any identifying personal data to be shared.</p>

    <h3>If I don't log out, is that safe?</h3>
    <p>Yes. As soon as you press the side button on the device, to lock it as you normally do, no one can get into your app or data while it's locked.</p>

    <h3>Why don’t I see any ads?</h3>
    <p>We want you to first try the app and see if you find useful, without any distractions. After you save 10 records, you may see a slim unintrusive ad banner, which helps support the app and keep it free.</p>

    <h3>I don’t like ads! Can I pay to remove them?</h3>
    <p>Yes! To do this, press the ❎ button on the banner. This will bring up the option to subscribe, for a nominal fee. While you are subscribed you will not see any ads.</p>

    <h3>Why should I subscribe? Why can’t I pay just once?</h3>
    <p>A small regular subscription fee makes the app easier to try without large upfront cost. Long-term, subscription revenue helps us maintain the app and funds the development of useful new features.</p>

    <h3>Is there anything I can do to support this app?</h3>
    <p>We're reliant on good reviews to grow the app and keep building new features. Please leave a review by following the link for your app:</p>

    <h2>Blood Pressure App</h2>
    <h3>What's too high or low a blood pressure?</h3>
    <p>Your blood pressure should normally be between 90-140 for systolic value, and 60-90 for diastolic value. If it's outside this range, you should speak to a doctor.</p>

    <h3>What's the ideal blood pressure?</h3>
    <p>According to the NHS, ideal blood pressure is between 90/60 mmHg and 120/80 mmHg. However, that can vary depending on sex, age, and other variables. Therefore it is best to consult your local doctor for an accurate assessment of your blood pressure based on your own individual circumstances.</p>

    <h3>What's Trends for?</h3>
    <p>With Trends, this app takes your data and notes, and shows what things affect you and how. For example, you could see that you meditated 20 times last year, and that meditation lowers your blood pressure. Conversely, you could see that every time you meet Bob, you argue, and he raises your blood pressure. The more you use notes, the more useful Trends can be.</p>

    <h3>Can you explain Trends with an example?</h3>
    <p>For example, you go running 10 times. 5 times, your blood pressure goes down by 10, and the other times it goes down by 5. Trends will show that on average, running helps reduce your blood pressure by about 7.5 points.</p>  


    <h2>Feeltracker Mood Diary App</h2>

    <h3>What's Trends for?</h3>
    <p>With Trends, this app takes your data and notes, and shows what things affect you and how. For example, you could see that you met Jane 20 times last year, and that on average, Jane makes you very happy. Conversely, you could see that every time you meet Bob, you argue, and he makes you unhappy. The more you use notes, the more useful Trends can be.</p>

    <h3>Can you explain Trends with an example?</h3>
    <p>For example, you meet Jane 10 times. 5 times she made you very happy (+2), and 5 times she made you fairly happy (+1). Trends will show that on average Jane makes you quite (+1.5) happy.</p>


    <h2>Daily Journal Notes App</h2>

    <h3>What's Trends for?</h3>
    <p>With Trends, this app takes your data and notes, and shows what words are most on your mind. For example, you could see that you used a word 20 times last year. Conversely, you could see that you used another word 50 times - a lot more often. The more you use notes, the more useful Trends can be.</p>

    <h3>Can you explain Trends with an example?</h3>
    <p>For example, you write about Jane 120 times in your notes, more than about your job, which you write about 50 times. Trends in this case shows that clearly the top thing on your mind was Jane.</p>


    <h2>Sleep Diary App</h2>

    <h3>What's Trends for?</h3>
    <p>With Trends, this app takes your data and notes, and shows what things affect you and how. For example, you could see that you drank a lot of coffee last week, and that because of this you had less sleep. Conversely, you could see that every time you eat salad or go to the gym, you lose sleep better. The more you use notes, the more useful Trends can be.</p>

    <h3>Can you explain Trends with an example?</h3>
    <p>For example, you drink coffee 10 times. 5 of those times, you underslept 2 hours, and the other 5 times you underslept 1 hour. Trends will show that on average, drinking coffee causes you to undersleep by 1.5 hours.</p>


    <h2>Weight and Body Fat Food Diary App</h2>

    <h3>What's Trends for?</h3>
    <p>With Trends, this app takes your data and notes, and shows what things affect you and how. For example, you could see that you ate fast food 20 times last year, and that over time, you gain weight when you eat fast food. Conversely, you could see that every time you eat salad or go to the gym, you lose weight. The more you use notes, the more useful Trends can be.</p>

    <h3>Can you explain Trends with an example?</h3>
    <p>For example, you eat donuts 10 times. 5 times, your weight goes up by 0.1kg. The other 5 times your weight goes up by 0.3kg. Trends will show that on average, eating donuts makes your weight go up by 0.2kg.</p>
