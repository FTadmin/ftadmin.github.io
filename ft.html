    <!-- How It Works -->
    <section class="platforms-section">
        <h2 class="center-text">How Feeltracker FT Works</h2>
        <p class="section-subtitle center-text">A comprehensive mood tracking system designed for emotional wellness and mental health awareness</p>
        <div class="app-card">
            <h3>1. Log Your Mood</h3>
            <div class="app-card-content">
                <p><strong>Simple Rating Scale:</strong> Multiple times a day, rate how you're feeling on an intuitive 1-5 scale. The system is designed to be quick - it takes just seconds to log a mood, making it easy to track consistently throughout your day.</p>
                <p><strong>Detailed Context:</strong> Add notes about what's happening - activities, interactions, medications, sleep, stress triggers, positive moments, or anything affecting your emotional state. The more context you provide, the more valuable insights you'll gain.</p>
                <p><strong>Emotion Labels:</strong> Tag entries with specific emotions beyond the numeric rating - anxious, hopeful, irritable, content, overwhelmed, peaceful. Build a nuanced picture of your emotional landscape that goes deeper than simple numbers.</p>
            </div>
        </div>
        <div class="app-card">
            <h3>2. See Patterns</h3>
            <div class="app-card-content">
                <p><strong>Calendar Visualization:</strong> View your complete mood history in an intuitive calendar interface. Each day displays your average mood with color coding. Instantly identify good weeks, rough patches, and emotional cycles at a glance.</p>
                <p><strong>Statistical Analysis:</strong> Automatically calculated metrics include daily, weekly, and monthly mood averages, mood stability scores, range of emotions, and trending patterns. See objective data about your emotional wellness over time.</p>
                <p><strong>Trend Charts:</strong> Beautiful graphs show your mood patterns across days, weeks, or months. Identify seasonal patterns, medication effects, therapy progress, and long-term emotional trajectories. Visual data makes patterns impossible to miss.</p>
            </div>
        </div>
        <div class="app-card">
            <h3>3. Discover Triggers</h3>
            <div class="app-card-content">
                <p><strong>AI Pattern Recognition:</strong> Artificial intelligence analyzes your notes and mood ratings to identify correlations. Discover insights like "Your mood is 40% higher on days when you exercise" or "Mood drops consistently after poor sleep."</p>
                <p><strong>Trigger Identification:</strong> Learn which people, places, activities, or situations consistently affect your mental health. The AI might reveal "You rate mood lower on days mentioning work deadlines" or "Mood improves when you write about social activities."</p>
                <p><strong>Conversational Insights:</strong> Ask natural language questions: "What improves my mood most?" or "Show me my worst days this month." The AI provides thoughtful answers based on your complete emotional tracking history.</p>
            </div>
        </div>
        <div class="app-card">
            <h3>4. Share with Care Team</h3>
            <div class="app-card-content">
                <p><strong>Professional Reports:</strong> Export comprehensive PDF or Excel reports formatted for clinical review. Reports include mood graphs, detailed statistics, notes about triggers and patterns, medication tracking, and therapy progress - everything your mental health provider needs.</p>
                <p><strong>Apple Health Integration:</strong> On iOS 18+, sync with Apple Health's State of Mind feature. Import mood data from other sources or export your FT tracking to HealthKit for integration with your complete health record.</p>
                <p><strong>DBT & CBT Support:</strong> Designed with input from mental health professionals. Features support Dialectical Behavior Therapy (DBT) and Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT) techniques. Track emotions, identify thought patterns, and monitor therapeutic progress effectively.</p>

    <!-- FAQ -->
    <section class="support-section">
        <h2>Frequently Asked Questions</h2>

        <h3>How often should I track my mood?</h3>
        <p>Mental health professionals typically recommend checking in 2-3 times per day - perhaps morning, afternoon, and evening. This gives you a balanced view of your emotional state throughout the day. You can set reminders in the app to help build this habit.</p>

        <h3>What is Apple Health State of Mind?</h3>
        <p>State of Mind is Apple's mental health tracking feature introduced in iOS 18. It lets you log your momentary emotions and daily mood. Feeltracker FT fully integrates with this feature, allowing your mood ratings to sync with Apple Health for comprehensive mental wellness tracking.</p>

        <h3>Can this app replace therapy?</h3>
        <p>No. Feeltracker FT is a tracking tool, not a treatment. It's designed to complement professional mental health care, not replace it. If you're struggling with your mental health, please consult a licensed therapist, counselor, or psychiatrist.</p>

        <h3>How does AI trigger detection work?</h3>
        <p>When you add notes to your mood entries, AI analyzes the text to identify recurring words and themes. For example, if you mention "coffee with Sarah" multiple times and your mood is consistently higher on those days, the app will show that as a positive influence. This happens entirely on your device for privacy.</p>

        <h3>Is my mood data private?</h3>
        <p>Absolutely. Your mood entries are encrypted and stored only on your device and in your private iCloud account. We never see, access, or share your mental health information. It's as private as your Apple Health data.</p>

        <h3>Can I export my mood history?</h3>
        <p>Yes. You can export your mood data as PDF, Excel, or JSON files. Many users share these reports with their therapist or doctor to provide context for treatment discussions.</p>

        <h3>Does it work offline?</h3>
        <p>Yes. You can log your mood anytime, even without an internet connection. Your entries will sync to iCloud when you're back online.</p>

        <h3>Can I track mood for specific conditions?</h3>
        <p>While the app provides general mood tracking, many users find it helpful for monitoring conditions like depression, anxiety, bipolar disorder, or seasonal affective disorder. Always discuss your tracking data with your healthcare provider.</p>
