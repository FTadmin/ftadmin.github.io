        <p class="section-subtitle center-text">A comprehensive system designed for effective blood pressure management</p>
        <div class="app-card">
            <h3>1. Record Your Reading</h3>
            <div class="app-card-content">
                <p><strong>Camera Scan AI:</strong> Simply point your camera at your blood pressure monitor's display and let AI automatically extract systolic, diastolic, and pulse values. No typing needed - the app reads the numbers directly from OMRON, Microlife, Beurer, and most digital monitors.</p>
                <p><strong>Manual Entry:</strong> Prefer to type? Enter values manually with a streamlined interface. Takes just seconds to log a reading.</p>
                <p><strong>Rich Context:</strong> Add detailed notes about what you were doing - meals eaten, medications taken, exercise, stress levels, sleep quality, or any factors that might affect your blood pressure. You can also attach photos and tag entries with custom labels for easier searching later.</p>
            </div>
        </div>
        <div class="app-card">
            <h3>2. Track Patterns</h3>
            <div class="app-card-content">
                <p><strong>Calendar View:</strong> See all your readings in an intuitive calendar layout. Each day shows your measurements with color-coded indicators for normal, elevated, or high readings based on medical guidelines.</p>
                <p><strong>Automatic Statistics:</strong> Get instant calculations of daily, weekly, and monthly averages. View your lowest and highest readings, standard deviation, and trends over time without doing any math.</p>
                <p><strong>Visual Charts:</strong> Beautiful graphs show your blood pressure trends over days, weeks, months, or any custom date range. Spot patterns at a glance and see how you're progressing toward your health goals.</p>

            <h3>3. Get AI Insights</h3>
            <div class="app-card-content">
                <p><strong>Pattern Detection:</strong> AI analyzes your readings and notes to identify correlations. Discover what activities, foods, or situations consistently raise or lower your blood pressure.</p>
                <p><strong>Personalized Recommendations:</strong> Get specific insights based on your data. The AI might notice patterns like "Your BP tends to be higher on days when you mention 'stressed at work'" or "Readings are lower on days with morning exercise."</p>
                <p><strong>Chat with Your Data:</strong> Ask questions in natural language like "What was my average BP in the evenings last month?" or "Show me readings after I took my medication." The AI understands context and gives you instant answers.</p>
            </div>
        </div>

    <!-- FAQ -->
    <section class="support-section">
        <h2>Frequently Asked Questions</h2>

        <h3>What is a normal blood pressure reading?</h3>
        <p>According to medical guidelines, normal blood pressure is typically below 120/80 mmHg. Readings between 120-129 systolic and below 80 diastolic are considered elevated. Values of 130/80 or higher may indicate hypertension. However, target ranges can vary by age and health conditions, so consult your doctor for personalized guidance.</p>

        <h3>How does Camera Scan AI work?</h3>
        <p>Simply point your iPhone or iPad camera at your blood pressure monitor's digital display. The app uses advanced AI-powered camera recognition technology to automatically read the numbers and populate the systolic, diastolic, and pulse fields. This eliminates manual typing errors and makes logging faster.</p>

        <h3>What is MAP and should I track it?</h3>
        <p>MAP (Mean Arterial Pressure) is a calculated value that represents the average blood pressure in your arteries during one cardiac cycle. It's calculated as: MAP = (2 × Diastolic + Systolic) ÷ 3. Some doctors find MAP useful for assessing cardiovascular risk. The app automatically calculates MAP for each reading.</p>

        <h3>Can I import my old blood pressure data?</h3>
        <p>Yes! If you've been tracking blood pressure in Apple Health, you can import all your historical readings into the app with one tap. The app also supports importing from CSV/Excel files if you have data from other sources.</p>

        <h3>How often should I check my blood pressure?</h3>
        <p>This depends on your health condition and your doctor's recommendations. Some people check daily (often morning and evening), while others check weekly. The app makes it easy to track as frequently as recommended by your healthcare provider. You can set reminders to help maintain a consistent schedule.</p>

        <h3>Is my blood pressure data private?</h3>
        <p>Absolutely. Your blood pressure readings are stored encrypted on your device and in your private iCloud account. The data never passes through our servers, and we cannot see your health information. It's as secure as Apple's Notes or Photos apps.</p>

        <h3>Can I track blood pressure for family members?</h3>
        <p>The app is designed for individual use and syncs with your personal iCloud account. For tracking multiple family members, each person should use the app on their own device with their own Apple ID.</p>

        <h3>Do I need a subscription?</h3>
        <p>The app is free to download and includes core tracking features. A premium subscription unlocks advanced AI features, unlimited exports, and removes ads. You can try all features free during the trial period.</p>

            <p class="review-content">"I've used other apps before, and I will tell you the AI feedback sets this app apart from all the rest. Freaking love this thing. Always kind of felt like I was flying in the dark most the time before this. I would try and google what the variations in my pressures could be, and what to watch for. The AI feedback does it all for me. Tells me what I want to keep an eye out for, always recommends consulting my doctor on anything I'm concerned about, but provides me a fundamental information of what the changes could be. Also even incorporates the one word notes I write about what was happening at the time I took the reading. Like stressed, tired, rested, etc. Yes amazing thorough feedback of possibilities, but always cautious to not take the place of our own responsibly to see a doctor, just terrific information you can actually take with you to show your doc if for any reason your concerns cause you to consult one. The creators nailed it seriously!!! Very appreciative."</p>

When I first started using it, I sent in a question to ask if it would update Apple health automatically and they said that it would be one of the things they would be looking at. As of this date, they've already made this update and it is working absolutely wonderful. The app is so simple to use and you're not have to hassle with any machine. With Omron I was always fighting to see if it would sync with Apple health, and the people that looked after the apps didn't seem to know what they were doing. This app has the ability to allow you to put your own information in and it automatically sync over to Apple health, no fuss no muss. Great App!!"</p>
