                <p class="review-content">"I've found the best blood pressure app I've ever tried. It not only lets me send results to my doctor, but people seem work tirelessly to keep the app running smoothly. They're constantly updating and improving it, which is awesome. Honestly, it's the best subscription I've got on my phone right now."</p>

                <p class="review-content">"I just got diagnosed with adhd about a month ago. And I had to wait for 3 weeks to get meds for it. During that time I found this app, and it's been pretty amazing to see the erraticness of my un medicated brain compared to my medicated brain. My medicated brain is much more level in the graph. Plus I like that I can jot down what's on my mind really fast."</p>

                <p class="review-content">"This is a nice little simple app that does not overextend into unneeded areas. It is the simplicity of it, including the simplicity of the interface that I value more than anything. I don't need flowers and squirrels and games and peekaboo things and rainbow unicorns. I just need a simple diary-like note app. So far this app has fulfilled those requirements or lack of requirements. It's sort of refreshing. I also appreciate that you can export it in PDF form when there is a need to do so. Thank you for keeping it simple."</p>

When I asked for an app, they suggested consensus Sleep Diary, which is useless. Luckily I found this app and I immediately asked my Sleep doctor to start recommending it. I also appreciate how responsive the developer is. Clearly this person wants to improve lives. THANK YOU!!"</p>

That was an error I made early on and can't seem to change without a Mac computer, according to Apple. Now getting down to reviewing this app. This app is awesome for monitoring your sleep habits, time and being able to make notes for future reference. It's simple and easy to use. I had a suggestion, something I was hoping to have changed, and the app developer Gaurav was absolutely amazing!! I reached out to him, and he got back to me within minutes and within days he actually added my suggestion! I highly recommend using this to keep a record of your sleep patterns. And it's absolutely worth subscribing to. Gaurav Sharma, you are a rockstar!!"</p>

                </div>
                <p class="review-content">"I needed something to help with sleep tracking as I was starting CPAP therapy back in November 2022. This app has been great at keeping me accountable to a schedule and looking at my progress. I can track hours slept, dreams I have had, patterns of sleep as well as other data that I want to review. Only issue is sometimes App does not open right away on my IPAD and have to force close it and then re-open it. Update - have used app 400 nights now and it shows me progress I've made in my CPAP therapy and a lot of useful insights!"</p>

It would be much more convenient if it stayed at the weight that you put in instead of having to scroll through the weights to get to where you're current weight. 2: the BMI should be automatically calculated instead of trying to do the calculation manually."</p>
