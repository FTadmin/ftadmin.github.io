Values of 130/80 or higher may indicate hypertension. However, target ranges can vary by age and health conditions, so consult your doctor for personalized guidance."

            "answer": "Simply point your iPhone or iPad camera at your blood pressure monitor's digital display. The app uses advanced AI-powered camera recognition technology to automatically read the numbers and populate the systolic, diastolic, and pulse fields. This eliminates manual typing errors and makes logging faster. [Get a blood pressure monitor here](https://geni.us/B9RB)."

            "question": "What is MAP and should I track it?",
            "answer": "MAP (Mean Arterial Pressure) is a calculated value that represents the average blood pressure in your arteries during one cardiac cycle. It's calculated as: MAP = (2 × Diastolic + Systolic) ÷ 3. Some doctors find MAP useful for assessing cardiovascular risk. The app automatically calculates MAP for each reading."

          {
            "question": "Can I import my old blood pressure data?",
            "answer": "Yes! If you've been tracking blood pressure in Apple Health, you can import all your historical readings into the app with one tap. The app also supports importing from CSV/Excel files if you have data from other sources."

          {
            "question": "How often should I check my blood pressure?",
            "answer": "This depends on your health condition and your doctor's recommendations. Some people check daily (often morning and evening), while others check weekly. The app makes it easy to track as frequently as recommended by your healthcare provider. You can set reminders to help maintain a consistent schedule."

This means we don't need to know your email address, name, or any personal information. Your blood pressure data is stored on your devices and in your iCloud account, and it's completely private whether you use the free version or premium."

Always kind of felt like I was flying in the dark most the time before this. I would try and google what the variations in my pressures could be, and what to watch for. The AI feedback does it all for me. Tells me what I want to keep an eye out for, always recommends consulting my doctor on anything I'm concerned about, but provides me a fundamental information of what the changes could be. Also even incorporates the one word notes I write about what was happening at the time I took the reading. Like stressed, tired, rested, etc. Yes amazing thorough feedback of possibilities, but always cautious to not take the place of our own responsibly to see a doctor, just terrific information you can actually take with you to show your doc if for any reason your concerns cause you to consult one.

With Omron I was always fighting to see if it would sync with Apple health, and the people that looked after the apps didn't seem to know what they were doing.

            "question": "Is my journal private?",
            "answer": "Absolutely. Your entries are stored encrypted on your device and in your private iCloud account. We never see your writing. Even the AI sentiment analysis happens entirely on your device using Apple's Natural Language API - your words never leave your phone."
          },
          {
            "question": "How does sentiment analysis work?",
            "answer": "When you write 8 or more words, the app uses Apple's built-in Natural Language framework to analyze the emotional tone. An emoji appears to show whether the entry reads as positive, negative, or neutral. This happens entirely on-device for complete privacy."
          },
          {
            "question": "What is word frequency analysis?",
            "answer": "The Trends feature analyzes all your entries to show which words and topics you write about most often. This helps you identify recurring themes, concerns, or interests in your thinking."
          },
          {
            "question": "Can I add photos to my journal?",
            "answer": "Yes! You can attach up to 8 photos to each journal entry. Photos are stored efficiently with automatic thumbnail generation, and they sync across all your devices via iCloud."
          },
          {
            "question": "What are note templates?",
            "answer": "Templates are pre-written prompts that help you start writing quickly. Create custom templates for things like gratitude lists, daily reviews, goal tracking, or any other recurring format you use."
          },
          {
            "question": "Can I export my journal entries?",
            "answer": "Yes. You can export your entries as PDF, Excel, or JSON files. This lets you create backups, share selected entries, or move your data to other platforms if needed."
          },
          {
            "question": "Does it work on Mac?",

          {
            "question": "Can I write multiple entries per day?",
            "answer": "Absolutely. Write as many entries as you want each day. Some people journal in the morning and evening, while others add notes throughout the day."
          },
          {
            "question": "Do you show ads or track me?",

This means we don't need to know your email address, name, or any personal information. Your journal entries are stored on your devices and in your iCloud account, and they're completely private whether you use the free version or premium."

I use this to jot down notes about tasks completed, calls made, info learned, etc. I am self-employed and wanted a simple method of keeping a record of info for the myriad projects I have going at any given time. It has a simple search function so as long as I keep my terminology/project name consistent I can pull up entries similar to tag-searching. I love the simplicity of what is essentially a calendar based notes app. I am able to make several short entries on a single date, all visible from the start screen. This feature is a huge part of the app's functionality for me because it allows me to glance at all my notes on a given day while keeping entries separated by project. There's no fancy/cutesy formatting that only shows previews of entries—you can read the entirety of each entry right from the main calendar page.",

The more context you provide, the more valuable insights you'll gain.\n\n**Emotion Labels:** Tag entries with specific emotions beyond the numeric rating - anxious, hopeful, irritable, content, overwhelmed, peaceful.

            "answer": "State of Mind is Apple's mental health tracking feature introduced in iOS 18. It lets you log your momentary emotions and daily mood. Mental Health fully integrates with this feature, allowing your mood ratings to sync with Apple Health for comprehensive mental wellness tracking."
          },
          {
            "question": "Can this app replace therapy?",
            "answer": "No. Mental Health is a tracking tool, not a treatment. It's designed to complement professional mental health care, not replace it. If you're struggling with your mental health, please consult a licensed therapist, counselor, or psychiatrist."
          },
          {
            "question": "How does AI trigger detection work?",
            "answer": "When you add notes to your mood entries, AI analyzes the text to identify recurring words and themes. For example, if you mention \"coffee with Sarah\" multiple times and your mood is consistently higher on those days, the app will show that as a positive influence. This happens entirely on your device for privacy."
          },
          {
            "question": "Is my mood data private?",
            "answer": "Absolutely. Your mood entries are encrypted and stored only on your device and in your private iCloud account. We never see, access, or share your mental health information. It's as private as your Apple Health data."
          },
          {
            "question": "Can I export my mood history?",
            "answer": "Yes. You can export your mood data as PDF, Excel, or JSON files. Many users share these reports with their therapist or doctor to provide context for treatment discussions."
          },
          {
            "question": "Does it work offline?",
            "answer": "Yes. You can log your mood anytime, even without an internet connection. Your entries will sync to iCloud when you're back online."
          },
          {
            "question": "Can I track mood for specific conditions?",
            "answer": "While the app provides general mood tracking, many users find it helpful for monitoring conditions like depression, anxiety, bipolar disorder, or seasonal affective disorder. Always discuss your tracking data with your healthcare provider."
          },
          {
            "question": "Do you show ads or track me?",
            "answer": "**No.** We've completely removed all advertisements from the app. We don't track you across other apps or websites, and we never sell your data to advertisers.\n\nYour data syncs via iCloud - just like Apple Notes and Photos. This means we don't need to know your email address, name, or any personal information. Your mental health data is stored on your devices and in your iCloud account, and it's completely private whether you use the free version or premium."
          },
          {
            "question": "Do I need a subscription?",
            "answer": "The app is completely free to download and use. All core tracking features work without a subscription. A premium subscription unlocks advanced AI features, unlimited exports, and enhanced customization. You can try all premium features during the free trial period."

            "question": "How much sleep do I need?",
            "answer": "Most adults need 7-9 hours of sleep per night, though individual needs vary. The app helps you track your sleep duration and identify your personal optimal amount based on how you feel."
          },
          {
            "question": "Does this app automatically track sleep?",
            "answer": "No. Unlike Apple Watch or other wearables, Sleep Diary requires manual logging. You enter your sleep and wake times each morning. However, you can import sleep data from Apple Health if you use other automatic tracking devices."
          },
          {
            "question": "Can I log naps?",
            "answer": "Yes. You can log multiple sleep periods per day, including naps. Each entry shows duration, and the calendar displays all your sleep/wake times."
          },
          {
            "question": "What's the difference between this and Apple Health?",
            "answer": "Sleep Diary provides a dedicated interface for sleep tracking with features specifically designed for managing sleep patterns - notes, AI insights, trends, and easy manual logging. It integrates with Apple Health but offers more detailed sleep-focused features."
          },
          {
            "question": "How does AI help with sleep insights?",
            "answer": "When you add notes about your day (e.g., \"had coffee at 8pm\" or \"exercised in the morning\"), AI analyzes these over time to show correlations with your sleep duration and quality. This helps identify what promotes or disrupts good sleep."
          },
          {
            "question": "Can I share sleep data with my doctor?",
            "answer": "Yes. Export your sleep history as PDF or Excel reports to share with healthcare providers. This is particularly useful if you're being evaluated for sleep disorders or insomnia."
          },
          {
            "question": "Does it track sleep quality or just duration?",
            "answer": "The app primarily tracks sleep duration (hours slept) based on your logged sleep and wake times. You can add notes about sleep quality, dreams, or how rested you feel, which helps with qualitative tracking."
          },
          {
            "question": "Is there a reminder to log sleep?",
            "answer": "Yes. You can set daily reminders to log your sleep times. Many users set a morning reminder to prompt them to record the previous night's sleep."
          },
          {
            "question": "Do you show ads or track me?",
            "answer": "**No.** We've completely removed all advertisements from the app. We don't track you across other apps or websites, and we never sell your data to advertisers.\n\nYour data syncs via iCloud - just like Apple Notes and Photos. This means we don't need to know your email address, name, or any personal information. Your sleep data is stored on your devices and in your iCloud account, and it's completely private whether you use the free version or premium."
          },
          {
            "question": "Do I need a subscription?",
            "answer": "The app is completely free to download and use. All core tracking features work without a subscription. A premium subscription unlocks advanced AI features, unlimited exports, and enhanced customization. You can try all premium features during the free trial period."

I had a suggestion, something I was hoping to have changed, and the app developer Gaurav was absolutely amazing!! I reached out to him, and he got back to me within minutes and within days he actually added my suggestion! I highly recommend using this to keep a record of your sleep patterns.

Only issue is sometimes App does not open right away on my IPAD and have to force close it and then re-open it.

          },
          {
            "question": "How often should I weigh myself?",
            "answer": "Most experts recommend weighing yourself once a week at the same time and day for consistency. Some people prefer daily weigh-ins to see the natural fluctuations. The app supports any frequency that works for you."
          },
          {
            "question": "What is BMI and why does it matter?",
            "answer": "BMI (Body Mass Index) is a measure of body fat based on height and weight. It's calculated as: weight (kg) / height (m)². A BMI of 18.5-24.9 is considered normal, 25-29.9 is overweight, and 30+ is obese. The app automatically calculates and displays your BMI with color-coded indicators."
          },
          {
            "question": "How do I measure body fat percentage?",
            "answer": "Body fat percentage requires a body composition scale - a special scale that measures both weight and body composition using bioelectrical impedance. These are available from brands like Omron, Tanita, and Withings. Standard scales only measure weight."
          },
          {
            "question": "Why does my weight fluctuate daily?",
            "answer": "Daily weight can vary by several pounds due to water retention, salt intake, hormones, meal timing, and bathroom habits. This is completely normal. Focus on weekly or monthly trends rather than daily changes."
          },
          {
            "question": "Can I import weight from Apple Health?",
            "answer": "Yes. The app can import all your historical weight data from Apple Health with one tap. This includes weight tracked by smart scales, Apple Watch, or other fitness apps."
          },
          {
            "question": "How does AI help with weight loss?",
            "answer": "When you add notes to your weight entries (like \"started keto\" or \"ate pizza\"), AI analyzes these over time to show correlations. For example, it might show that weeks when you meal prep correlate with better weight loss, or that eating out frequently correlates with weight gain."
          },
          {
            "question": "Can I track weight in pounds and kilograms?",
            "answer": "Yes. The app supports both imperial (pounds, feet/inches) and metric (kilograms, centimeters) units. You can switch between them in settings."
          },
          {
            "question": "Can I export my weight data?",
            "answer": "Yes. Export your weight history as PDF charts, Excel spreadsheets, or JSON data. Share reports with your doctor, trainer, or nutritionist."
          },
          {
            "question": "Is this a diet or meal tracking app?",
            "answer": "No. Weight & Food focuses on tracking body measurements (weight, BMI, body fat). It doesn't track calories or meals. However, you can add notes about your diet to help identify what affects your weight."
          },
          {
            "question": "Do you show ads or track me?",
            "answer": "**No.** We've completely removed all advertisements from the app. We don't track you across other apps or websites, and we never sell your data to advertisers.\n\nYour data syncs via iCloud - just like Apple Notes and Photos. This means we don't need to know your email address, name, or any personal information. Your weight and health data is stored on your devices and in your iCloud account, and it's completely private whether you use the free version or premium."

Both options are shown to by the arrows in the image below.</p>\n    <img src=\"../images/add_new.jpg\" class=\"screenshot\">\n\n    <h3>Can I record multiple times a day?</h3>\n    <p>Yes. You can add many records per day, as shown above. Just press on the day again, or on +, to do this.</p>\n\n    <h3>How do I delete a record?</h3>\n    <p>To delete a record, you can swipe left on the record and press Delete, or press on the record to open it and press the trash can icon in the top left of the screen. Both methods are shown below:</p>\n    <p>\n        <img src=\"../images/delete_swipe.jpg\" class=\"screenshot-small padded10\">\n        <img src=\"../images/delete_trashcan.jpg\" class=\"screenshot-small padded10\">\n    </p>\n\n    <h3>Why do I see a sentiment score above my notes? Is this private?</h3>\n    <p>When your notes contain 8 or more words, an emoji will appear above them to indicate the predicted sentiment. This feature can help you understand if your writing comes across as overly negative or positive, or remind you of what is or isn't working, serving as a guide for your writing. The sentiment is calculated entirely on your device using Apple's Natural Language API, so no data leaves your device, ensuring complete privacy. If you prefer, you can disable this feature in Settings under General.</p>\n\n    <h3>How do I print?</h3\n    <p>When you press export (as shown below), you'll see a share sheet. On this, scroll down and press Print (as shown below). You'll need an Apple AirPrint compatible wireless printer to print wirelessly from your iPhone or iPad.</p>\n    <p>If you don't have an AirPrint compatible wireless printer, you can buy one <a href=\"https://geni.us/airprint_printer\">here</a>.\n    </p>\n    <p> <img src=\"../images/printing_example_ios.jpg\" class=\"screenshot\"></p>\n\n    <h3>Can I share any medical information I'm tracking with my doctor?</h3>\n    <p>Yes. The app makes this easy to do. Press the share button (as shown below), select PDF, and then choose your Mail app. The PDF report will be attached to an email you can then send to your doctor.</p>\n    <p> <img src=\"../images/sharing_example.jpg\" class=\"screenshot\"></p>\n\n    <h3>How can I hide averages or totals in Journal?</h3>\n    <p>You can hide averages and totals in view options, as shown below. That will then only show your entered values, and not averages. This can be useful if you find having the averages/totals in between your entered data confusing.</p>\n    <p> <img src=\"../images/hide_averages.jpg\" class=\"screenshot\"></p>\n\n\n    <h3>Can I export to Excel or similar spreadsheet software?</h3>\n    <p>Yes. Follow the instructions above, but select Excel or CSV instead of PDF as output format. Then either save the file on your device, or email it to yourself.</p>\n    <p> Excel format is more reliable, while CSV may be more widely compatible - both should open in Excel and similar software, like Apple Numbers or Google Sheets.</p>\n\n    <h3>Who can I send my data to?</h3>\n    <p>You can email it to anyone you like. You might want to periodically email your data to yourself for safekeeping and backup purposes. You can also save the PDF or CSV file on your device for later use.</p>\n\n    <h3>How do I scroll straight to the current day in month view?</h3>\n    <p>Double-tap the Journal icon in the tab bar at the bottom of your screen.</p>\n\n    <h3>How do I view data from previous months?</h3>\n    <p>To view data from a previous month (for example, September data when you're currently in October):</p>\n    <ul>\n      <li>Go to the Journal tab</li>\n      <li>Press the back button in the top left corner - this will take you to month selection</li>\n      <li>Select the month you want to view (e.g., September)</li>\n      <li>If you don't see your data, press the Journal options button (the 2nd button along the top, next to the back button) and ensure all display options are set to \"Show\"</li>\n    </ul>\n    <p>Your data is always saved and accessible - you can navigate between months at any time to view your historical records.</p>\n    <p><strong>If you still don't see your data after checking the month view:</strong> Go to Settings > Data > Manage Backups and look for any backups from the month you're trying to view (or early in the following month). If you find a backup from that time period, you can restore from it to recover your data. This can help if you've reinstalled the app or if there was a sync issue.</p>\n\n    <h3>How do I change the time or date on a record?</h3>\n    <p>Open a record and simply tap on the time or date to change it, as shown below.</p>\n    <p> <img src=\"../images/change_time_date.jpg\" class=\"screenshot\"></p>\n\n    <h3>How safe is my data?</h3>\n    <p>Your data is encrypted when stored on your device. This means even if your device is stolen, no one can access it.</p>\n\n    <h3>Where is my data stored?</h3>\n    <p>On your device, and on iCloud. This app uses the same technology as Apple Notes and Photos to save and sync your data across devices, meaning it's very reliable and secure.</p>\n\n    <h3>Can anyone else see my private data?</h3>\n    <p>No. The data only ever lives on your device and on iCloud, which runs on servers managed by Apple.</p>\n\n    <h3>Why does my data need to be saved on iCloud?</h3>\n    <p>iCloud enables your data to be backed up, and synced between your devices. Then if you lose your phone or get a new one, your data can be restored from iCloud.</p>\n\n    <h3>Why isn't my data syncing across my devices?</h3>\n    <p>Your data should automatically be synced across your devices. Ensure that:</p>\n    <ul>\n      <li>You're logged into the same iCloud account on all devices. </li>\n      <li>All iOS devices are on the same version of iOS (preferably the latest).</li>\n      <li>Ensure iCloud drive is On on all devices (in Settings > Your Name > iCloud > iCloud Drive, as shown below.</li>\n      <p><img src=\"../images/icloud_on.png\" class=\"screenshot\"></p>\n    </ul>\n\n    <h3>Do I have to have a subscription for each device?</h3>\n    <p>One subscription will remove ads on all devices. If you see ads on any additional devices, go to Settings > Remove Ads, and press Restore Purchase. Ensure each device is logged into the same iCloud account.</p>\n\n    <h3>How do Backups work?</h3>\n    <p>Backups are made automatically every week by default (although you can turn this off in Settings). You can also create manual backups in Settings > Data.</p>\n\n    <h3>How many backups are made? Should I delete them?</h3>\n    <p>There’s no limit to number of backups made. Backups can go back years, and generally take very little space, so deleting them won't make much difference to your device's storage. If you need to free up space, it's better to delete heavier files on your device such as photos and videos.</p>\n\n    <h3>Are backups synced to iCloud?</h3>\n    <p>Currently backups aren’t synced on iCloud, but your current data is. That means if you get a new iPhone or iPad, your current data will appear there too, but not your backups, as each device keeps its own local backups.</p><p>This means that, for example if you delete a record on your iPhone and it’s gone from iCloud and your phone, you could still go back to your iPad and restore from one of its older backup snapshots.</p>\n\n    <h3>Do I need an account to use this app?</h3>\n    <p>No. You can use it straight away without needing to login in or sign up. The app uses your iCloud account to automatically sync your data to any other devices, using Apple's infrastructure. This means it's fast, reliable and secure.</p>\n\n    <h3>Can I use this app on both my iPhone and iPad?</h3>\n    <p>Yes, and your data is automatically synced between them if logged into the same iCloud account. On the iPad version you have more space for notes, and can see more items.</p>\n\n    <h3>Is there a Mac version of the app?</h3>\n    <p>Yes. The apps is available for Apple Silicon Macs (M1 onwards). In the Mac app, you can resize the window to see more data on larger screens. You can download the Mac app <a href=\"https://apps.apple.com/us/developer/custom-arts/id968118447\">here</a> on your M1 or later Mac.</p>\n\n    <h3>I would like to suggest a feature or improvement for the app.</h3>\n    <p>We'd love to hear your feedback. Email us at <a href=\"mailto:feedback@feeltracker.com\">feedback@feeltracker.com</a>.</p>\n\n    <h3>Can I turn off the sound?</h3>\n    <p>Yes. Go to the Settings tab and turn off the slider next to Enable Sound Effects.</p>\n\n    <h3>What's the Trends tab for?</h3>\n    <p>Trends lets you identify what's on your mind, why, and the effect it's having on you. Scroll down for more detail and some examples on how Trends works in your app.</p>\n\n    <h3>Why do I not see anything in Trends?</h3>\n    <p>For Trends to work, you need to take notes when you save records. You can do this on any record in the Notes field.</p>\n\n    <h3>What's the Stats tab for?</h3>\n    <p>This currently shows you all records between 2 dates, and an average/total in between that range. This enables you to get an average/total for any period.</p>\n\n    <h3>What’s the difference between Journal, Trends and Stats?</h3>\n    <p>Journal is the main diary/log section which lets you input data and view it on a monthly/yearly/lifetime basis, with averages and totals</p>\n    <p>Trends lets you identify patterns in the data you're recording in Journal so you can act on them.</p>\n    <p>Stats lets you see your data in chronological order (newest item first) without monthly or yearly grouping, and let's you see averages and totals between any two dates.<p>\n\n    <h3>Should I log out or shut down, to save phone memory and battery?</h3>\n    <p> There's no need at all to log out – the device automatically unloads apps/resources from memory as needed.</p>\n    <p>Modern iPhones and iPads have a lot of energy-efficient memory, so apps can stay in memory for a long time without any adverse effects. Access to this memory is secure, and is already proteced by Face ID, Touch ID, or a passcode.</p>\n\n    <p>If you'd like to close an app anyway (for example if it has become unresponsive) you can follow Apple's instructions <a href=\"https://support.apple.com/en-gb/HT201330\">here</a>.</p>\n    <p>There's no need to login either, as the app uses your iCloud account so already can sync/backup data across your devices, similar to how the Photos and Notes app do, without requiring any identifying personal data to be shared.</p>\n\n    <h3>If I don't log out, is that safe?</h3>\n    <p>Yes. As soon as you press the side button on the device, to lock it as you normally do, no one can get into your app or data while it's locked.</p>\n\n    <h3>What's with the ads?</h3>\n    <p>We want you to first try the app and see if you find useful, without any distractions - you can do this for free, without seeing Google ads. After you save 7 records, you may see some Google ads, which help support the app and keep it free.</p>\n\n    <h3>I don’t like ads! Can I pay to remove them?</h3>\n    <p>Yes! To do this, press the ❎ button on the banner. This will bring up the option to subscribe, for a nominal fee. While you are subscribed you will not see any ads.</p>\n\n    <h3>I'm unable to pay, but hate ads in apps!</h3>\n    <p>We hear you. These customised native ads are designed to blend in with the rest of the app and still look good, without being jarring or spammy. We want you to be able to enjoy using the app, even if you're unable to pay. Don't forget to tell your friends about it!</p>\n\n    <h3>Why should I subscribe? Why can’t I pay just once?</h3>\n    <p>A small regular subscription fee makes the app easier to try without large upfront cost. Long-term, subscription revenue helps us maintain the app and funds the development of useful new features.</p>\n\n    <h3>Is there anything I can do to support this app?</h3>\n    <p>We're reliant on good reviews to grow the app and keep building new features. Please leave a review by following the link for your app:</p>\n    <ul>\n      <li><a href = \"https://apps.apple.com/app/id794542324?action=write-review\">Blood Pressure Monitor Checker</a></li>\n      <li><a href = \"https://apps.apple.com/app/id1557699226?action=write-review\">Daily Journaling</a></li>\n      <li><a href = \"https://apps.apple.com/app/id687448999?action=write-review\">Feeltracker Mood Journal</a></li>\n      <li><a href = \"https://apps.apple.com/app/id799503787?action=write-review\">Weight and Body Fat Journal</a></li>\n      <li><a href = \"https://apps.apple.com/app/id1065268459?action=write-review\">Sleep and Nap Journal</a></li>\n    </ul>\n\n    <h3>I want to cancel my paid subscription</h3>\n    <p>Thank you for trying the app. Let me know if there’s anything I can do better at <a href=\"mailto:gs@feeltracker.com\">gs@feeltracker.com</a> and I'll try to help. Often, fixes and improvements based on user feedback are shipped in an app update on the same or next day.</p>\n    <p>If still not satisfied, you can cancel your subscription <a href=\"https://apps.apple.com/account/subscriptions\">here</a>.</p>\n\n    <h2>Blood Pressure App</h2>\n\n    <h3>Does the app connect to my blood pressure monitor via Bluetooth?</h3>\n    <p>No, the app does not connect directly to blood pressure monitors via Bluetooth. Instead, we've focused on making manual entry effortless through AI camera scanning technology. Simply point your iPhone's camera at your monitor's display after taking a reading, and the app automatically reads the numbers. This works with virtually any blood pressure monitor that has a digital display, regardless of brand or model. There's no pairing required, no specific device compatibility to worry about, and it takes just seconds. This feature is always free and unlimited.</p>\n\n    <h3>How does AI Camera Scanning work?</h3>\n    <p>After taking your blood pressure reading, open the app and tap the \"+\" button, then select \"Scan with Camera.\" Hold your phone steady about 6-12 inches away from your monitor's display, making sure the numbers are clearly visible and well-lit. The app will automatically read the systolic, diastolic, and pulse values. For best results, ensure good lighting and keep your phone steady while scanning. This works with most digital monitors including OMRON, Microlife, and Beurer brands.</p>\n\n    <h3>Why am I seeing duplicate entries?</h3>\n    <p>This is usually caused by Apple Health sync configuration. The most common issue is having only write permissions enabled for Apple Health, but not read permissions. To fix this: Go to Settings > Data > Apple Health, and make sure BOTH read AND write permissions are enabled for Blood Pressure and Heart Rate - not just write. The app needs read permission to check if a reading already exists before importing from Health.</p>\n\n    <h3>Can I track readings for multiple family members?</h3>\n    <p>A tags feature is coming within the next few months that will let you track readings for multiple people on one device. You'll be able to tag each entry with a person's name and then generate individual reports for each family member.</p>\n\n    <h3>My data isn't syncing between my iPhone and iPad. Why?</h3>\n    <p>First, make sure you're signed into the same iCloud account on both devices. Go to Settings > [Your Name] and check the Apple ID. Second, verify that iCloud Drive is enabled on both devices (Settings > [Your Name] > iCloud > iCloud Drive). Your data syncs automatically through iCloud, but it requires an internet connection and can take a few minutes. Try opening the app on each device and pulling down to refresh.</p>\n\n    <h3>What does the subscription include? What's free?</h3>\n    <p>All core tracking features are completely free: unlimited entries, AI camera scanning (always free), all charts and trends, Apple Health sync, and PDF/CSV exports. The subscription adds: ad removal for a clean experience, enhanced AI chat (100 uses per day vs 10 free), and access to advanced AI features. All future premium features will be included for subscribers.</p>\n\n    <h3>What is MAP and should I track it?</h3>\n    <p>MAP (Mean Arterial Pressure) represents the average pressure in your arteries during one cardiac cycle. It's calculated automatically for every reading. MAP is particularly important for LVAD (Left Ventricular Assist Device) patients and others with specific cardiovascular conditions. To enable MAP display, go to Settings > Blood Pressure > Show Mean Arterial Pressure (MAP). Customizable MAP ranges are coming in version 2.8.x.</p>\n\n    <h3>How do I use note templates to save time?</h3>\n    <p>When entering a note (like \"Morning reading - before medication\"), tap the \"Template\" button at the bottom left of the notes field and save it as a template. Next time you enter a reading, tap \"Template\" again and select from your saved templates - the text is inserted instantly. This is great for recurring notes like \"Morning - pre-medication\" or \"Evening - after dinner.\"</p>\n\n    <h3>What's too high or low a blood pressure?</h3>\n    <p>Your blood pressure should normally be between 90-140 for systolic value, and 60-90 for diastolic value. If it's outside this range, you should speak to a doctor.</p>\n\n    <h3>What's the ideal blood pressure?</h3>\n    <p>According to the NHS, ideal blood pressure is between 90/60 mmHg and 120/80 mmHg. However, that can vary depending on sex, age, and other variables. Therefore it is best to consult your local doctor for an accurate assessment of your blood pressure based on your own individual circumstances.</p>\n\n    <h3>How do I measure my blood pressure?</h3>\n    <p>Blood pressure is measured using a digital blood pressure monitor. <a href=\"https://geni.us/B9RB\">Here</a> you can find blood pressure monitors that work great with the Camera Scan AI feature. The app can automatically read values from most digital monitors including OMRON, Microlife, and Beurer brands.</p>\n\n    <h3>What's Trends for?</h3>\n    <p>With Trends, this app takes your data and notes, and shows what things affect you and how. For example, you could see that you meditated 20 times last year, and that meditation lowers your blood pressure. Conversely, you could see that every time you meet Bob, you argue, and he raises your blood pressure. The more you use notes, the more useful Trends can be.</p>\n\n    <h3>Can you explain Trends with an example?</h3>\n    <p>For example, you go running 10 times. 5 times, your blood pressure goes down by 10, and the other times it goes down by 5. Trends will show that on average, running helps reduce your blood pressure by about 7.5 points.</p>  \n\n\n    <h2>Feeltracker Mood Diary App</h2>\n\n    <h3>What's Trends for?</h3>\n    <p>With Trends, this app takes your data and notes, and shows what things affect you and how. For example, you could see that you met Jane 20 times last year, and that on average, Jane makes you very happy. Conversely, you could see that every time you meet Bob, you argue, and he makes you unhappy. The more you use notes, the more useful Trends can be.</p>\n\n    <h3>Can you explain Trends with an example?</h3>\n    <p>For example, you meet Jane 10 times. 5 times she made you very happy (+2), and 5 times she made you fairly happy (+1). Trends will show that on average Jane makes you quite (+1.5) happy.</p>\n\n\n    <h2>Daily Journaling Notes App</h2>\n\n    <h3>What's Trends for?</h3>\n    <p>With Trends, this app takes your data and notes, and shows what words are most on your mind. For example, you could see that you used a word 20 times last year. Conversely, you could see that you used another word 50 times - a lot more often. The more you use notes, the more useful Trends can be.</p>\n\n    <h3>Can you explain Trends with an example?</h3>\n    <p>For example, you write about Jane 120 times in your notes, more than about your job, which you write about 50 times. Trends in this case shows that clearly the top thing on your mind was Jane.</p>\n\n\n    <h2>Sleep Diary App</h2>\n\n    <h3>What's Trends for?</h3>\n    <p>With Trends, this app takes your data and notes, and shows what things affect you and how. For example, you could see that you drank a lot of coffee last week, and that because of this you had less sleep. Conversely, you could see that every time you eat salad or go to the gym, you lose sleep better. The more you use notes, the more useful Trends can be.</p>\n\n    <h3>Can you explain Trends with an example?</h3>\n    <p>For example, you drink coffee 10 times. 5 of those times, you underslept 2 hours, and the other 5 times you underslept 1 hour. Trends will show that on average, drinking coffee causes you to undersleep by 1.5 hours.</p>\n\n\n    <h2>Weight and Body Fat Food Diary App</h2>\n\n    <h3>What's Trends for?</h3>\n    <p>With Trends, this app takes your data and notes, and shows what things affect you and how. For example, you could see that you ate fast food 20 times last year, and that over time, you gain weight when you eat fast food. Conversely, you could see that every time you eat salad or go to the gym, you lose weight. The more you use notes, the more useful Trends can be.</p>\n\n    <h3>Can you explain Trends with an example?</h3>\n    <p>For example, you eat donuts 10 times. 5 times, your weight goes up by 0.1kg. The other 5 times your weight goes up by 0.3kg. Trends will show that on average, eating donuts makes your weight go up by 0.2kg.</p>\n\n    <h3>How do I measure body fat?</h3>\n    <p>Body Fat is reported by specially designed weight scales that measure body composition, as well as the weight. <a href=\"https://geni.us/PQXEb\">Here</a> is an example of such scale, from Omron. There will be other options available too from other brands - the thing to look for is “Body Composition” as well as weighing scales.</p><p>Note also that even if you only enter weight, you’ll still see a BMI value (to the left of weight, color coded), which will give a broad indication of whether you are of a healthy weight (where green is good, and red is overweight).</p>\n\n    <h2>Contact Us</h2>\n    <p>If you have any questions or suggestions, do not hesitate to contact us at <a href=\"mailto:support@feeltracker.com\">support@feeltracker.com</a>.</p>"

You’re not allowed to attempt to extract the source code of the app, and you also shouldn’t try to translate the app into other languages or make derivative versions. The app itself, and all the trademarks, copyright, database rights, and other intellectual property rights related to it, still belong to Custom Arts Ltd.</p>\n\n    <p>Custom Arts Ltd is committed to ensuring that the app is as useful and efficient as possible. For that reason, we reserve the right to make changes to the app or to charge for its services at any time and for any reason. We will never charge you for the app or its services without making it very clear to you exactly what you’re paying for.</p>\n\n    <p>The Feeltracker app stores and processes data using Apple’s iCloud service. All data generated by the app is synced across your devices via iCloud, and Custom Arts Ltd does not have access to this data.

We recommend that you do not jailbreak or root your phone, which is the process of removing software restrictions and limitations imposed by the official operating system of your device. It could make your phone vulnerable to malware/viruses/malicious programs, compromise your phone’s security features, and it could mean that the Feeltracker app won’t work properly or at all.</p>\n\n    <div>\n      <p>The app does use third-party services that declare their own Terms and Conditions.</p>\n      <p>Links to the Terms and Conditions of third-party service providers used by the app:</p>\n      <ul>\n        <li><a href=\"https://developers.google.com/admob/terms\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">AdMob</a></li>\n        <li><a href=\"https://firebase.google.com/terms/analytics\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Google Analytics for Firebase</a></li>\n        <li><a href=\"https://firebase.google.com/terms/crashlytics\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Firebase Crashlytics</a></li>\n        <li><a href=\"https://www.revenuecat.com/terms\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">RevenueCat</a></li>\n      </ul>\n    </div>\n\n    <p>You should be aware that there are certain things that Custom Arts Ltd will not take responsibility for. Certain functions of the app will require the app to have an active internet connection. The connection can be Wi-Fi or provided by your mobile network provider, but Custom Arts Ltd cannot take responsibility for the app not working at full functionality if you don’t have access to Wi-Fi, or if you don’t have any of your data allowance left.</p>\n\n    <p>If you’re using the app outside of an area with Wi-Fi, you should remember that the terms of the agreement with your mobile network provider will still apply. As a result, you may be charged by your mobile provider for the cost of data for the duration of the connection while accessing the app, or other third-party charges. In using the app, you’re accepting responsibility for any such charges, including roaming data charges if you use the app outside of your home territory (i.e. region or country) without turning off data roaming. If you are not the bill payer for the device on which you’re using the app, please be aware that we assume that you have received permission from the bill payer for using the app.</p>\n\n    <p>Similarly, Custom Arts Ltd cannot always take responsibility for the way you use the app. For example, you need to make sure that your device stays charged – if it runs out of battery and you can’t turn it on to avail of the Service, Custom Arts Ltd cannot accept responsibility.</p>\n\n    <p>With respect to Custom Arts Ltd’s responsibility for your use of the app, it’s important to bear in mind that although we endeavor to ensure that it is updated and correct at all times, we do rely on third parties to provide information to us so that we can make it available to you. Custom Arts Ltd accepts no liability for any loss, direct or indirect, you experience as a result of relying wholly on this functionality of the app.</p>\n\n    <p>At some point, we may wish to update the app. The app is currently available on iOS – the requirements for the system (and for any additional systems we decide to extend the availability of the app to) may change, and you’ll need to download the updates if you want to keep using the app. Custom Arts Ltd does not promise that it will always update the app so that it is relevant to you and/or works with the iOS version that you have installed on your device. However, you promise to always accept updates to the application when offered to you. We may also wish to stop providing the app and may terminate use of it at any time without giving notice of termination to you. Unless we tell you otherwise, upon any termination, (a) the rights and licenses granted to you in these terms will end; (b) you must stop using the app, and (if needed) delete it from your device.</p>\n\n    <h2>OpenAI Services and Liability</h2>\n    <p>Our app utilizes OpenAI’s API to provide AI-driven features, such as generating feedback or content based on user input.

I had a suggestion, something I was hoping to have changed, and the app developer Gaurav was absolutely amazing!! I reached out to him, and he got back to me within minutes and within days he actually added my suggestion! I highly recommend using this to keep a record of your sleep patterns.
