        },
        {
          "question": "Does this app automatically track sleep?",
          "answer": "No. Unlike Apple Watch or other wearables, Sleep Diary requires manual logging. You enter your sleep and wake times each morning. However, you can import sleep data from Apple Health if you use other automatic tracking devices."
        },
        {
          "question": "Can I log naps?",

        },
        {
          "question": "How does AI help with sleep insights?",
          "answer": "When you add notes about your day (e.g., \"had coffee at 8pm\" or \"exercised in the morning\"), AI analyzes these over time to show correlations with your sleep duration and quality. This helps identify what promotes or disrupts good sleep."
        },
        {
          "question": "Can I share sleep data with my doctor?",

        {
          "question": "Does it track sleep quality or just duration?",
          "answer": "The app primarily tracks sleep duration (hours slept) based on your logged sleep and wake times. You can add notes about sleep quality, dreams, or how rested you feel, which helps with qualitative tracking."
        },
        {
          "question": "Is there a reminder to log sleep?",
          "answer": "Yes. You can set daily reminders to log your sleep times. Many users set a morning reminder to prompt them to record the previous night's sleep."
        },
        {
          "question": "Do you show ads or track me?",
          "answer": "**No.** We've completely removed all advertisements from the app. We don't track you across other apps or websites, and we never sell your data to advertisers.\n\nYour data syncs via iCloud - just like Apple Notes and Photos. This means we don't need to know your email address, name, or any personal information. Your sleep data is stored on your devices and in your iCloud account, and it's completely private whether you use the free version or premium."
        },
        {
          "question": "Do I need a subscription?",
          "answer": "The app is completely free to download and use. All core tracking features work without a subscription. A premium subscription unlocks advanced AI features, unlimited exports, and enhanced customization. You can try all premium features during the free trial period."

When I asked for an app, they suggested consensus Sleep Diary, which is useless. Luckily I found this app and I immediately asked my Sleep doctor to start recommending it. I also appreciate how responsive the developer is. Clearly this person wants to improve lives. THANK YOU!!",

That was an error I made early on and can't seem to change without a Mac computer, according to Apple. Now getting down to reviewing this app. This app is awesome for monitoring your sleep habits, time and being able to make notes for future reference. It's simple and easy to use. I had a suggestion, something I was hoping to have changed, and the app developer Gaurav was absolutely amazing!! I reached out to him, and he got back to me within minutes and within days he actually added my suggestion! I highly recommend using this to keep a record of your sleep patterns. And it's absolutely worth subscribing to. Gaurav Sharma, you are a rockstar!!",

This app has been great at keeping me accountable to a schedule and looking at my progress. I can track hours slept, dreams I have had, patterns of sleep as well as other data that I want to review. Only issue is sometimes App does not open right away on my IPAD and have to force close it and then re-open it. Update - have used app 400 nights now and it shows me progress I've made in my CPAP therapy and a lot of useful insights!",
