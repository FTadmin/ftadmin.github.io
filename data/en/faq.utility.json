            "answer": "When your notes contain 8 or more words, an emoji will appear above them to indicate the predicted sentiment. This feature can help you understand if your writing comes across as overly negative or positive, or remind you of what is or isn't working, serving as a guide for your writing. The sentiment is calculated entirely on your device using Apple's Natural Language API, so no data leaves your device, ensuring complete privacy. If you prefer, you can disable this feature in Settings under General."

          {
            "question": "Can I export to Excel or similar spreadsheet software?",
            "answer": "Yes. Follow the instructions above, but select Excel or CSV instead of PDF as output format. Then either save the file on your device, or email it to yourself.\n\n Excel format is more reliable, while CSV may be more widely compatible - both should open in Excel and similar software, like Apple Numbers or Google Sheets."

            "answer": "Open a record and tap on the date or time at the top of the screen, as shown below. A calendar will appear where you can select the correct date, then press Save.\n\n**Tip:** To always create a record for today's date, press the + next to the current day, or press the + in the top right of the screen. If a record ended up on the wrong date, it may be because the + was pressed next to a different day — some users use this for historical records or future planning.",

          {
            "question": "Where is my data stored?",
            "answer": "On your device, and on iCloud. This app uses the same technology as Apple Notes and Photos to save and sync your data across devices, meaning it's very reliable and secure."
          },
          {
            "question": "Can anyone else see my private data?",
            "answer": "No. The data only ever lives on your device and on iCloud, which runs on servers managed by Apple."

          {
            "question": "Why does my data need to be saved on iCloud?",
            "answer": "iCloud enables your data to be backed up, and synced between your devices. Then if you lose your phone or get a new one, your data can be restored from iCloud."

            "question": "Why isn't my data syncing across my devices?",

              "You're logged into the same iCloud account on all devices.",
              "All iOS devices are on the same version of iOS (preferably the latest).",

            "question": "Do I have to have a subscription for each device?",
            "answer": "One subscription will remove ads on all devices. If you see ads on any additional devices, go to Settings > Remove Ads, and press Restore Purchase. Ensure each device is logged into the same iCloud account."
          },
          {
            "question": "How do Backups work?",
            "answer": "Backups are made automatically every week by default (although you can turn this off in Settings). You can also create manual backups in Settings > Data."
          },
          {
            "question": "How many backups are made? Should I delete them?",
            "answer": "There’s no limit to number of backups made. Backups can go back years, and generally take very little space, so deleting them won't make much difference to your device's storage. If you need to free up space, it's better to delete heavier files on your device such as photos and videos."
          },
          {
            "question": "Are backups synced to iCloud?",
            "answer": "Currently backups aren’t synced on iCloud, but your current data is. That means if you get a new iPhone or iPad, your current data will appear there too, but not your backups, as each device keeps its own local backups.\n\nThis means that, for example if you delete a record on your iPhone and it’s gone from iCloud and your phone, you could still go back to your iPad and restore from one of its older backup snapshots."
          },
          {
            "question": "Do I need an account to use this app?",
            "answer": "No. You can use it straight away without needing to login in or sign up. The app uses your iCloud account to automatically sync your data to any other devices, using Apple's infrastructure. This means it's fast, reliable and secure."
          },
          {
            "question": "Can I use this app on both my iPhone and iPad?",
            "answer": "Yes, and your data is automatically synced between them if logged into the same iCloud account. On the iPad version you have more space for notes, and can see more items."
          },
          {
            "question": "Is there a Mac version of the app?",
            "answer": "Yes. The apps is available for Apple Silicon Macs (M1 onwards). In the Mac app, you can resize the window to see more data on larger screens. You can download the Mac app [here](https://apps.apple.com/us/developer/custom-arts/id968118447) on your M1 or later Mac."

          {
            "question": "Can I turn off the sound?",

          },
          {
            "question": "What's the Trends tab for?",
            "answer": "Trends lets you identify what's on your mind, why, and the effect it's having on you. Scroll down for more detail and some examples on how Trends works in your app."
          },
          {
            "question": "Why do I not see anything in Trends?",
            "answer": "For Trends to work, you need to take notes when you save records. You can do this on any record in the Notes field."
          },
          {
            "question": "What's the Stats tab for?",
            "answer": "This currently shows you all records between 2 dates, and an average/total in between that range. This enables you to get an average/total for any period."
          },
          {
            "question": "What’s the difference between Journal, Trends and Stats?",
            "answer": "Journal is the main diary/log section which lets you input data and view it on a monthly/yearly/lifetime basis, with averages and totals\n\nTrends lets you identify patterns in the data you're recording in Journal so you can act on them.\n\nStats lets you see your data in chronological order (newest item first) without monthly or yearly grouping, and let's you see averages and totals between any two dates."
          },
          {
            "question": "Should I log out or shut down, to save phone memory and battery?",
            "answer": "There's no need at all to log out – the device automatically unloads apps/resources from memory as needed.\n\nModern iPhones and iPads have a lot of energy-efficient memory, so apps can stay in memory for a long time without any adverse effects. Access to this memory is secure, and is already proteced by Face ID, Touch ID, or a passcode.\n\nIf you'd like to close an app anyway (for example if it has become unresponsive) you can follow Apple's instructions [here](https://support.apple.com/en-gb/HT201330).\n\nThere's no need to login either, as the app uses your iCloud account so already can sync/backup data across your devices, similar to how the Photos and Notes app do, without requiring any identifying personal data to be shared."
          },
          {
            "question": "If I don't log out, is that safe?",
            "answer": "Yes. As soon as you press the side button on the device, to lock it as you normally do, no one can get into your app or data while it's locked."
          },
          {
            "question": "What's with the ads?",
            "answer": "We want you to first try the app and see if you find useful, without any distractions - you can do this for free, without seeing Google ads. After you save 7 records, you may see some Google ads, which help support the app and keep it free."
          },
          {
            "question": "I don’t like ads! Can I pay to remove them?",
            "answer": "Yes! To do this, press the ❎ button on the banner. This will bring up the option to subscribe, for a nominal fee. While you are subscribed you will not see any ads."
          },
          {
            "question": "I'm unable to pay, but hate ads in apps!",
            "answer": "We hear you. These customised native ads are designed to blend in with the rest of the app and still look good, without being jarring or spammy. We want you to be able to enjoy using the app, even if you're unable to pay. Don't forget to tell your friends about it!"
          },
          {
            "question": "Why should I subscribe? Why can’t I pay just once?",
            "answer": "A small regular subscription fee makes the app easier to try without large upfront cost. Long-term, subscription revenue helps us maintain the app and funds the development of useful new features."

          {
            "question": "Is there anything I can do to support this app?",

          {
            "question": "Does the app connect to my blood pressure monitor via Bluetooth?",
            "answer": "No, the app does not connect directly to blood pressure monitors via Bluetooth. Instead, we've focused on making manual entry effortless through AI camera scanning technology. Simply point your iPhone's camera at your monitor's display after taking a reading, and the app automatically reads the numbers. This works with virtually any blood pressure monitor that has a digital display, regardless of brand or model. There's no pairing required, no specific device compatibility to worry about, and it takes just seconds. This feature is always free and unlimited."
          },
          {
            "question": "How does AI Camera Scanning work?",
            "answer": "After taking your blood pressure reading, open the app and tap the \"+\" button, then select \"Scan with Camera.\" Hold your phone steady about 6-12 inches away from your monitor's display, making sure the numbers are clearly visible and well-lit. The app will automatically read the systolic, diastolic, and pulse values. For best results, ensure good lighting and keep your phone steady while scanning. This works with most digital monitors including OMRON, Microlife, and Beurer brands."
          },
          {
            "question": "Why am I seeing duplicate entries?",
            "answer": "This is usually caused by Apple Health sync configuration. The most common issue is having only write permissions enabled for Apple Health, but not read permissions. To fix this: Go to Settings > Data > Apple Health, and make sure BOTH read AND write permissions are enabled for Blood Pressure and Heart Rate - not just write. The app needs read permission to check if a reading already exists before importing from Health."
          },
          {
            "question": "Can I track readings for multiple family members?",
            "answer": "A tags feature is coming within the next few months that will let you track readings for multiple people on one device. You'll be able to tag each entry with a person's name and then generate individual reports for each family member."
          },
          {
            "question": "My data isn't syncing between my iPhone and iPad. Why?",
            "answer": "First, make sure you're signed into the same iCloud account on both devices. Go to Settings > [Your Name] and check the Apple ID. Second, verify that iCloud Drive is enabled on both devices (Settings > [Your Name] > iCloud > iCloud Drive). Your data syncs automatically through iCloud, but it requires an internet connection and can take a few minutes. Try opening the app on each device and pulling down to refresh."
          },
          {
            "question": "What does the subscription include? What's free?",
            "answer": "All core tracking features are completely free: unlimited entries, AI camera scanning (always free), all charts and trends, Apple Health sync, and PDF/CSV exports. The subscription adds: ad removal for a clean experience, enhanced AI chat (100 uses per day vs 10 free), and access to advanced AI features. All future premium features will be included for subscribers."
          },
          {
            "question": "What is MAP and should I track it?",
            "answer": "MAP (Mean Arterial Pressure) represents the average pressure in your arteries during one cardiac cycle. It's calculated automatically for every reading. MAP is particularly important for LVAD (Left Ventricular Assist Device) patients and others with specific cardiovascular conditions. To enable MAP display, go to Settings > Blood Pressure > Show Mean Arterial Pressure (MAP). Customizable MAP ranges are coming in version 2.8.x."
          },
          {
            "question": "How do I use note templates to save time?",
            "answer": "When entering a note (like \"Morning reading - before medication\"), tap the \"Template\" button at the bottom left of the notes field and save it as a template. Next time you enter a reading, tap \"Template\" again and select from your saved templates - the text is inserted instantly. This is great for recurring notes like \"Morning - pre-medication\" or \"Evening - after dinner.\""

          {
            "question": "What's too high or low a blood pressure?",
            "answer": "Your blood pressure should normally be between 90-140 for systolic value, and 60-90 for diastolic value. If it's outside this range, you should speak to a doctor."
          },
          {
            "question": "What's the ideal blood pressure?",
            "answer": "According to the NHS, ideal blood pressure is between 90/60 mmHg and 120/80 mmHg. However, that can vary depending on sex, age, and other variables. Therefore it is best to consult your local doctor for an accurate assessment of your blood pressure based on your own individual circumstances."
          },
          {
            "question": "How do I measure my blood pressure?",
            "answer": "Blood pressure is measured using a digital blood pressure monitor. [Here](https://geni.us/B9RB) you can find blood pressure monitors that work great with the Camera Scan AI feature. The app can automatically read values from most digital monitors including OMRON, Microlife, and Beurer brands."

            "question": "What's Trends for?",

[Here](https://geni.us/PQXEb) is an example of such scale, from Omron. There will be other options available too from other brands - the thing to look for is “Body Composition” as well as weighing scales.\n\nNote also that even if you only enter weight, you’ll still see a BMI value (to the left of weight, color coded), which will give a broad indication of whether you are of a healthy weight (where green is good, and red is overweight)."
