        {
          "question": "How does Camera Scan AI work?",
          "answer": "Simply point your iPhone or iPad camera at your scale's digital display. The app uses advanced AI-powered camera recognition technology to automatically read your weight and populate the field. This eliminates manual typing errors and makes logging faster and easier."
        },
        {
          "question": "How often should I weigh myself?",
          "answer": "Most experts recommend weighing yourself once a week at the same time and day for consistency. Some people prefer daily weigh-ins to see the natural fluctuations. The app supports any frequency that works for you."
        },
        {
          "question": "What is BMI and why does it matter?",
          "answer": "BMI (Body Mass Index) is a measure of body fat based on height and weight. It's calculated as: weight (kg) / height (m)². A BMI of 18.5-24.9 is considered normal, 25-29.9 is overweight, and 30+ is obese. The app automatically calculates and displays your BMI with color-coded indicators."
        },
        {
          "question": "How do I measure body fat percentage?",
          "answer": "Body fat percentage requires a body composition scale - a special scale that measures both weight and body composition using bioelectrical impedance. These are available from brands like Omron, Tanita, and Withings. Standard scales only measure weight."
        },
        {
          "question": "Why does my weight fluctuate daily?",
          "answer": "Daily weight can vary by several pounds due to water retention, salt intake, hormones, meal timing, and bathroom habits. This is completely normal. Focus on weekly or monthly trends rather than daily changes."
        },
        {
          "question": "Can I import weight from Apple Health?",
          "answer": "Yes. The app can import all your historical weight data from Apple Health with one tap. This includes weight tracked by smart scales, Apple Watch, or other fitness apps."
        },
        {
          "question": "How does AI help with weight loss?",
          "answer": "When you add notes to your weight entries (like \"started keto\" or \"ate pizza\"), AI analyzes these over time to show correlations. For example, it might show that weeks when you meal prep correlate with better weight loss, or that eating out frequently correlates with weight gain."
        },
        {
          "question": "Can I track weight in pounds and kilograms?",
          "answer": "Yes. The app supports both imperial (pounds, feet/inches) and metric (kilograms, centimeters) units. You can switch between them in settings."
        },
        {
          "question": "Can I export my weight data?",
          "answer": "Yes. Export your weight history as PDF charts, Excel spreadsheets, or JSON data. Share reports with your doctor, trainer, or nutritionist."
        },
        {
          "question": "Is this a diet or meal tracking app?",
          "answer": "No. Weight & Food focuses on tracking body measurements (weight, BMI, body fat). It doesn't track calories or meals. However, you can add notes about your diet to help identify what affects your weight."
        },
        {
          "question": "Do you show ads or track me?",
          "answer": "**No.** We've completely removed all advertisements from the app. We don't track you across other apps or websites, and we never sell your data to advertisers.\n\nYour data syncs via iCloud - just like Apple Notes and Photos. This means we don't need to know your email address, name, or any personal information. Your weight and health data is stored on your devices and in your iCloud account, and it's completely private whether you use the free version or premium."
        },
        {
          "question": "Do I need a subscription?",
          "answer": "The app is completely free to download and use. All core tracking features work without a subscription. A premium subscription unlocks advanced AI features, unlimited exports, and enhanced customization. You can try all premium features during the free trial period."
