          "question": "How does AI trigger detection work?",
          "answer": "When you add notes to your mood entries, AI analyzes the text to identify recurring words and themes. For example, if you mention \"coffee with Sarah\" multiple times and your mood is consistently higher on those days, the app will show that as a positive influence. This happens entirely on your device for privacy."
        },
        {
          "question": "Is my mood data private?",
          "answer": "Absolutely. Your mood entries are encrypted and stored only on your device and in your private iCloud account. We never see, access, or share your mental health information. It's as private as your Apple Health data."
        },
        {
          "question": "Can I export my mood history?",
          "answer": "Yes. You can export your mood data as PDF, Excel, or JSON files. Many users share these reports with their therapist or doctor to provide context for treatment discussions."
        },
        {
          "question": "Does it work offline?",
          "answer": "Yes. You can log your mood anytime, even without an internet connection. Your entries will sync to iCloud when you're back online."
        },
        {
          "question": "Can I track mood for specific conditions?",
          "answer": "While the app provides general mood tracking, many users find it helpful for monitoring conditions like depression, anxiety, bipolar disorder, or seasonal affective disorder. Always discuss your tracking data with your healthcare provider."
        },
        {
          "question": "Do you show ads or track me?",
          "answer": "**No.** We've completely removed all advertisements from the app. We don't track you across other apps or websites, and we never sell your data to advertisers.\n\nYour data syncs via iCloud - just like Apple Notes and Photos. This means we don't need to know your email address, name, or any personal information. Your mental health data is stored on your devices and in your iCloud account, and it's completely private whether you use the free version or premium."
        },
        {
          "question": "Do I need a subscription?",
          "answer": "The app is completely free to download and use. All core tracking features work without a subscription. A premium subscription unlocks advanced AI features, unlimited exports, and enhanced customization. You can try all premium features during the free trial period."

During that time I found this app, and it's been pretty amazing to see the erraticness of my un medicated brain compared to my medicated brain. My medicated brain is much more level in the graph. Plus I like that I can jot down what's on my mind really fast.",
