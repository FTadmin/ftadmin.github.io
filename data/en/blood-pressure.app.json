          "answer": "According to medical guidelines, normal blood pressure is typically below 120/80 mmHg. Readings between 120-129 systolic and below 80 diastolic are considered elevated. Values of 130/80 or higher may indicate hypertension. However, target ranges can vary by age and health conditions, so consult your doctor for personalized guidance."
        },
        {
          "question": "How does Camera Scan AI work?",
          "answer": "Simply point your iPhone or iPad camera at your blood pressure monitor's digital display. The app uses advanced AI-powered camera recognition technology to automatically read the numbers and populate the systolic, diastolic, and pulse fields. This eliminates manual typing errors and makes logging faster. [Get a blood pressure monitor here](https://geni.us/B9RB)."
        },
        {
          "question": "What is MAP and should I track it?",
          "answer": "MAP (Mean Arterial Pressure) is a calculated value that represents the average blood pressure in your arteries during one cardiac cycle. It's calculated as: MAP = (2 × Diastolic + Systolic) ÷ 3. Some doctors find MAP useful for assessing cardiovascular risk. The app automatically calculates MAP for each reading."
        },
        {
          "question": "Can I import my old blood pressure data?",
          "answer": "Yes! If you've been tracking blood pressure in Apple Health, you can import all your historical readings into the app with one tap. The app also supports importing from CSV/Excel files if you have data from other sources."
        },
        {
          "question": "How often should I check my blood pressure?",
          "answer": "This depends on your health condition and your doctor's recommendations. Some people check daily (often morning and evening), while others check weekly. The app makes it easy to track as frequently as recommended by your healthcare provider. You can set reminders to help maintain a consistent schedule."
        },
        {
          "question": "Is my blood pressure data private?",
          "answer": "Absolutely. Your blood pressure readings are stored encrypted on your device and in your private iCloud account. The data never passes through our servers, and we cannot see your health information. It's as secure as Apple's Notes or Photos apps."
        },
        {
          "question": "Can I track blood pressure for family members?",
          "answer": "The app is designed for individual use and syncs with your personal iCloud account. For tracking multiple family members, each person should use the app on their own device with their own Apple ID."
        },
        {
          "question": "Do you show ads or track me?",
          "answer": "**No.** We've completely removed all advertisements from the app. We don't track you across other apps or websites, and we never sell your data to advertisers.\n\nYour data syncs via iCloud - just like Apple Notes and Photos. This means we don't need to know your email address, name, or any personal information. Your blood pressure data is stored on your devices and in your iCloud account, and it's completely private whether you use the free version or premium."
        },
        {
          "question": "Do I need a subscription?",
          "answer": "The app is completely free to download and use. All core tracking features work without a subscription. A premium subscription unlocks advanced AI features, unlimited exports, and enhanced customization. You can try all premium features during the free trial period."

Always kind of felt like I was flying in the dark most the time before this. I would try and google what the variations in my pressures could be, and what to watch for. The AI feedback does it all for me. Tells me what I want to keep an eye out for, always recommends consulting my doctor on anything I'm concerned about, but provides me a fundamental information of what the changes could be. Also even incorporates the one word notes I write about what was happening at the time I took the reading. Like stressed, tired, rested, etc. Yes amazing thorough feedback of possibilities, but always cautious to not take the place of our own responsibly to see a doctor, just terrific information you can actually take with you to show your doc if for any reason your concerns cause you to consult one. The creators nailed it seriously!!! Very appreciative.",

With Omron I was always fighting to see if it would sync with Apple health, and the people that looked after the apps didn't seem to know what they were doing.
