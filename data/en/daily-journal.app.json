        {
          "question": "Is my journal private?",
          "answer": "Absolutely. Your entries are stored encrypted on your device and in your private iCloud account. We never see your writing. Even the AI sentiment analysis happens entirely on your device using Apple's Natural Language API - your words never leave your phone."
        },
        {
          "question": "How does sentiment analysis work?",
          "answer": "When you write 8 or more words, the app uses Apple's built-in Natural Language framework to analyze the emotional tone. An emoji appears to show whether the entry reads as positive, negative, or neutral. This happens entirely on-device for complete privacy."
        },
        {
          "question": "What is word frequency analysis?",
          "answer": "The Trends feature analyzes all your entries to show which words and topics you write about most often. This helps you identify recurring themes, concerns, or interests in your thinking."
        },
        {
          "question": "Can I add photos to my journal?",
          "answer": "Yes! You can attach up to 8 photos to each journal entry. Photos are stored efficiently with automatic thumbnail generation, and they sync across all your devices via iCloud."
        },
        {
          "question": "What are note templates?",
          "answer": "Templates are pre-written prompts that help you start writing quickly. Create custom templates for things like gratitude lists, daily reviews, goal tracking, or any other recurring format you use."
        },
        {
          "question": "Can I export my journal entries?",
          "answer": "Yes. You can export your entries as PDF, Excel, or JSON files. This lets you create backups, share selected entries, or move your data to other platforms if needed."
        },
        {
          "question": "Does it work on Mac?",
          "answer": "Yes! The app runs natively on Apple Silicon Macs (M1 and later). Your entries sync automatically between your iPhone, iPad, and Mac via iCloud."
        },
        {
          "question": "Can I write multiple entries per day?",
          "answer": "Absolutely. Write as many entries as you want each day. Some people journal in the morning and evening, while others add notes throughout the day."
        },
        {
          "question": "Do you show ads or track me?",
          "answer": "**No.** We've completely removed all advertisements from the app. We don't track you across other apps or websites, and we never sell your data to advertisers.\n\nYour data syncs via iCloud - just like Apple Notes and Photos. This means we don't need to know your email address, name, or any personal information. Your journal entries are stored on your devices and in your iCloud account, and they're completely private whether you use the free version or premium."
        },
        {
          "question": "Do I need a subscription?",
          "answer": "The app is completely free to download and use. All core tracking features work without a subscription. A premium subscription unlocks advanced AI features, unlimited exports, and enhanced customization. You can try all premium features during the free trial period."

I use this to jot down notes about tasks completed, calls made, info learned, etc. I am self-employed and wanted a simple method of keeping a record of info for the myriad projects I have going at any given time. It has a simple search function so as long as I keep my terminology/project name consistent I can pull up entries similar to tag-searching. I love the simplicity of what is essentially a calendar based notes app. I am able to make several short entries on a single date, all visible from the start screen. This feature is a huge part of the app's functionality for me because it allows me to glance at all my notes on a given day while keeping entries separated by project. There's no fancy/cutesy formatting that only shows previews of entries—you can read the entirety of each entry right from the main calendar page.",

I just need a simple diary-like note app. So far this app has fulfilled those requirements or lack of requirements. It's sort of refreshing. I also appreciate that you can export it in PDF form when there is a need to do so. Thank you for keeping it simple.",
