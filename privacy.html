    <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
<p>Custom Arts Ltd built the Feeltracker app as a Freemium app. This SERVICE is provided by Custom Arts Ltd at no cost and is intended for use as is.</p>
<p>This page is used to inform visitors regarding our policies with the collection, use, and disclosure of information if anyone decided to use our Service.</p>
<p>If you choose to use our Service, then you agree to the collection and use of information in relation to this policy. However, the Feeltracker app does not collect or store any personally identifiable information (PII) on our servers. All data generated by the app is stored locally on your device or synced with your personal iCloud account. We do not have access to this data.</p>

<h2>Data Controller and Registration</h2>
<p>Custom Arts Ltd is the data controller for the Feeltracker app and is responsible for your personal data. We are registered with the UK Information Commissioner's Office (ICO).</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Company:</strong> Custom Arts Ltd</li>
  <li><strong>ICO Registration Number:</strong> ZB644620</li>
  <li><strong>Contact Email:</strong> <a href="mailto:support@feeltracker.com">support@feeltracker.com</a></li>
</ul>
<p>You can verify our registration on the <a href="https://ico.org.uk/ESDWebPages/Entry/ZB644620" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">ICO Register</a>.</p>

<h2>GDPR Compliance</h2>
<p>We are committed to protecting your privacy and complying with data protection laws, including the UK General Data Protection Regulation (UK GDPR) and the EU General Data Protection Regulation (EU GDPR).</p>
<p>Under these regulations, you have several rights regarding your personal data:</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Right to Access:</strong> You can request a copy of the personal data we hold about you.</li>
  <li><strong>Right to Rectification:</strong> You can request correction of inaccurate or incomplete data.</li>
  <li><strong>Right to Erasure:</strong> You can request deletion of your personal data in certain circumstances.</li>
  <li><strong>Right to Restrict Processing:</strong> You can request that we limit how we use your data.</li>
  <li><strong>Right to Data Portability:</strong> You can request your data in a portable format.</li>
  <li><strong>Right to Object:</strong> You can object to certain types of processing.</li>
  <li><strong>Right to Withdraw Consent:</strong> Where processing is based on consent, you can withdraw it at any time.</li>
</ul>
<p>To exercise any of these rights, please contact us at <a href="mailto:support@feeltracker.com">support@feeltracker.com</a>. Since Feeltracker stores all user data locally on your device or in your personal iCloud account, you have direct control over your data and can access, export, or delete it at any time through the app's Settings.</p>

<h2>Legal Basis for Processing</h2>
<p>Where we process personal data, we do so on the following legal bases under GDPR:</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Consent:</strong> For optional features such as AI-powered analysis where data is sent to third-party services.</li>
  <li><strong>Legitimate Interests:</strong> For analytics and crash reporting to improve app performance and user experience.</li>
  <li><strong>Contract Performance:</strong> To provide the Service you have requested.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Privacy-First Approach</h2>
<p><strong>No Advertisements, No IDFA Tracking:</strong> Feeltracker apps do not display any advertisements and do not use Apple's Identifier for Advertisers (IDFA) or any other advertising tracking technologies. We do not track you across other apps or websites, and we do not sell your data to advertisers. Your health data is yours alone.</p>

<h2>Information Collection and Use</h2>
<p>For a better experience while using our Service, the Feeltracker app may utilize iCloud for data syncing across your devices. This data is stored securely in your iCloud account, and we do not collect or access any personal data from you. You can control iCloud data through your device's iCloud settings.</p>

<div>
  <p>The app uses third-party services that collect pseudonymised usage data (such as analytics and crash reports) to improve the app experience. We use Firebase Analytics without IDFA (Apple's Identifier for Advertisers) tracking, and no advertising identifiers are collected.</p>
  <p>Link to the privacy policy of third-party service providers used by the app:</p>
  <ul>
    <li><a href="https://firebase.google.com/policies/analytics" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Google Analytics for Firebase</a></li>
    <li><a href="https://firebase.google.com/support/privacy/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Firebase Crashlytics</a></li>
    <li><a href="https://www.revenuecat.com/privacy" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">RevenueCat</a></li>
  </ul>
</div>

<h2>iCloud Syncing</h2>
<p>Feeltracker stores and syncs user data across devices using Apple’s iCloud service. This allows you to access your health diary across your Apple devices seamlessly. Data stored in iCloud is protected by Apple’s privacy and security measures. We do not have access to this data. For more information on Apple’s iCloud privacy, please refer to <a href="https://www.apple.com/legal/privacy/en-ww/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Apple’s Privacy Policy</a>.</p>

<h2>Log Data</h2>
<p>In the case of an error or crash in the app, we collect log data through third-party services such as Firebase Crashlytics. This log data does not include personally identifiable information and is used only to diagnose and fix errors to improve the app’s performance.</p>

<h2>Cookies</h2>
<p>The Feeltracker app itself does not use cookies. However, the app may use third-party services or libraries that use “cookies” to collect non-personally identifiable data. You have the option to either accept or refuse these cookies and know when a cookie is being sent to your device. If you choose to refuse the cookies, you may not be able to use some portions of the Service.</p>

<h2>Service Providers</h2>
<p>We may employ third-party companies and individuals for the following reasons:</p>
<ul>
  <li>To facilitate our Service;</li>
  <li>To provide the Service on our behalf;</li>
  <li>To perform Service-related services; or</li>
  <li>To assist us in analyzing how our Service is used.</li>
</ul>
<p>These third-party services may collect non-personally identifiable information as described above, but they are obligated not to disclose or use the information for any other purpose.</p>

<h2>International Data Transfers</h2>
<p>Some of our third-party service providers are based outside the UK and European Economic Area (EEA), primarily in the United States:</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Google LLC</strong> (Firebase Analytics, Firebase Crashlytics) - United States</li>
  <li><strong>RevenueCat Inc</strong> - United States</li>
  <li><strong>OpenAI LLC</strong> - United States</li>
</ul>
<p>When data is transferred to these providers, it is protected by appropriate safeguards including Standard Contractual Clauses (SCCs) approved by the European Commission and/or the EU-US Data Privacy Framework where applicable. These mechanisms ensure that your data receives an adequate level of protection as required by UK and EU data protection law.</p>
<p>You can request more information about these safeguards by contacting us at <a href="mailto:support@feeltracker.com">support@feeltracker.com</a>.</p>

<h2>Data Retention</h2>
<p>We retain data for the following periods:</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Your app data:</strong> Stored on your device and in your personal iCloud account until you delete it. You have full control over this data.</li>
  <li><strong>Analytics data:</strong> Google Analytics for Firebase retains user-level data for 2 months by default.</li>
  <li><strong>Crash reports:</strong> Firebase Crashlytics retains crash data for 90 days.</li>
  <li><strong>Subscription data:</strong> RevenueCat retains purchase and subscription data for the duration of your subscription plus up to 7 years for legal and tax compliance purposes.</li>
  <li><strong>AI interactions:</strong> When you use AI features, your input is processed by OpenAI and may be retained for up to 30 days for abuse monitoring, unless you opt out. We do not store AI conversation history on our servers. See <a href="https://openai.com/policies/privacy-policy" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">OpenAI's data retention policy</a> for details.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Security</h2>
<p>We value your trust in providing us your information through the use of iCloud. We strive to use commercially acceptable means of protecting it. However, please remember that no method of transmission over the internet or method of electronic storage is 100% secure and reliable, and we cannot guarantee its absolute security.</p>

<h2>Links to Other Sites</h2>
<p>This Service may contain links to other sites. If you click on a third-party link, you will be directed to that site. Note that these external sites are not operated by us. Therefore, we strongly advise you to review the Privacy Policy of these websites. We have no control over and assume no responsibility for the content, privacy policies, or practices of any third-party sites or services.</p>

<h2>Children’s Privacy</h2>
<p>The Feeltracker app is not intended for children under the age of 12. We do not knowingly collect personally identifiable information from users under 12 years of age. If we become aware that a child under 12 has provided us with personal information, we will take steps to delete it immediately.</p>
<p>If you are a parent or guardian and believe that your child under 12 has provided us with personal information, please contact us so that we can take appropriate action.</p>

<h2>Use of OpenAI Services</h2>
<p>Our app integrates services provided by OpenAI, which may process user inputs (such as text or other data) to generate AI-powered feedback, suggestions, or content. When using these services, the data you provide is transmitted to OpenAI’s servers for processing. This data is used solely for the purpose of providing the requested AI response and is not stored or used for any other purpose unless explicitly stated in OpenAI's privacy policy.</p>
<p>We recommend reviewing OpenAI's privacy policy to understand how your data is handled by them: 
    <a href="https://openai.com/policies/privacy-policy" target="_blank">OpenAI Privacy Policy</a>.</p>
